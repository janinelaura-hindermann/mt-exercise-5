S@@ ever@@ al years ago here at TED@@ , P@@ eter Sk@@ ill@@ man in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed a design chall@@ enge called the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allow chall@@ eng@@ e.
And the ide@@ a@@ 's pretty simpl@@ e: Te@@ ams of four have to build the t@@ all@@ est fre@@ e-@@ standing structure out of 20 st@@ ic@@ ks of sp@@ ag@@ h@@ et@@ ti@@ , one y@@ ard of ta@@ p@@ e, one y@@ ard of str@@ ing and a mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allo@@ w.
The mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allow has to be on to@@ p.
And, though it seems really simpl@@ e, it's actually pretty hard because it forc@@ es people to coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ate very qu@@ ic@@ kl@@ y.
And so, I thought this was an interesting ide@@ a, and I in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated it into a design work@@ sho@@ p.
And it was a huge succ@@ ess.
And since then, I've con@@ duc@@ ted about 7@@ 0 design work@@ sho@@ ps across the world with students and design@@ ers and architec@@ ts, even the C@@ T@@ O@@ s of the F@@ ort@@ un@@ e 50@@ , and there's something about this ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise that re@@ ve@@ als very de@@ ep l@@ ess@@ ons about the nature of coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation, and I'd like to share some of them with you.
So, norm@@ ally, most people beg@@ in by ori@@ ent@@ ing them@@ selves to the t@@ as@@ k.
They talk about it, they figure out what it's going to look like, they jo@@ ck@@ ey for power@@ .
Then they spend some time pl@@ ann@@ ing, organiz@@ ing, they sk@@ et@@ ch and they la@@ y out sp@@ ag@@ h@@ et@@ ti@@ .
They spend the maj@@ or@@ ity of their time ass@@ em@@ bl@@ ing the st@@ ic@@ ks into ever@@ -@@ gro@@ wing struc@@ tur@@ es.
And then fin@@ ally, just as they're run@@ ning out of time, someone takes out the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allo@@ w, and then they g@@ ing@@ er@@ ly put it on to@@ p, and then they stand back, and -- ta@@ -@@ da@@ ! -- they ad@@ mir@@ e their work.
But what really happen@@ s, most of the time, is that the "@@ ta@@ -@@ da@@ " turns into an "@@ u@@ h@@ -@@ oh@@ ," because the wei@@ ght of the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allow caus@@ es the entire structure to bu@@ ck@@ le and to coll@@ ap@@ se.
So there are a number of people who have a lot more "@@ u@@ h@@ -@@ oh@@ " mom@@ ents than other@@ s, and am@@ ong the wor@@ st are rec@@ ent gra@@ du@@ ates of business school@@ .
They li@@ e, they che@@ at, they get di@@ str@@ ac@@ ted and they produ@@ ce really l@@ ame struc@@ tur@@ es.
And of course there are te@@ ams that have a lot more "@@ ta@@ -@@ da@@ " struc@@ tur@@ es, and am@@ ong the best are rec@@ ent gra@@ du@@ ates of kin@@ der@@ gar@@ t@@ en.
And it's pretty amaz@@ ing.
As P@@ eter tell@@ s us, not only do they produ@@ ce the t@@ all@@ est struc@@ tur@@ es, but they're the most interesting struc@@ tures of them all.
So the question you want to ask is@@ : How com@@ e? Wh@@ y? What is it about them@@ ?
And P@@ eter lik@@ es to say that n@@ one of the kids spend any time trying to be C@@ E@@ O of Sp@@ ag@@ h@@ et@@ ti@@ , In@@ c@@ . Righ@@ t?
They don't spend time jo@@ ck@@ e@@ ying for power@@ .
But there's another reason as well.
And the reason is that business students are train@@ ed to find the single right pl@@ an, right?
And then they ex@@ ec@@ ute on it.
And then what happens is, when they put the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allow on the to@@ p, they run out of time and what happ@@ ens@@ ?
It's a c@@ ris@@ is.
S@@ o@@ und famili@@ ar@@ ? Righ@@ t.
What kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers do differ@@ ently is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allo@@ w, and they build pro@@ to@@ typ@@ es, succ@@ es@@ sive pro@@ to@@ typ@@ es, always ke@@ ep@@ ing the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allow on to@@ p, so they have mul@@ ti@@ ple times to fi@@ x when they build pro@@ to@@ typ@@ es along the way.
D@@ es@@ ign@@ ers recogn@@ ize this ty@@ pe of coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation as the ess@@ ence of the it@@ er@@ ative proc@@ ess.
And with each ver@@ sion, kids get inst@@ ant fe@@ ed@@ back about what works and what doesn't work.
So the cap@@ ac@@ ity to play in pro@@ to@@ ty@@ pe is really essenti@@ al, but let's look at how different te@@ ams per@@ form@@ .
So the aver@@ age for most people is around 20 in@@ ch@@ es@@ ; business school@@ s stud@@ ents, about half of that@@ ; la@@ w@@ y@@ ers, a little bet@@ ter, but not much better than that, kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers, better than most ad@@ ul@@ ts.
Wh@@ o does the very bes@@ t?
Ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts and engine@@ ers, th@@ ank@@ ful@@ ly.
Th@@ ir@@ ty@@ -@@ n@@ ine in@@ ches is the t@@ all@@ est structure I've se@@ en.
And why is it? Because they understand tri@@ ang@@ les and self-@@ r@@ ein@@ forc@@ ing ge@@ om@@ et@@ ri@@ cal pat@@ ter@@ ns are the key to building st@@ able struc@@ tur@@ es.
So C@@ E@@ O@@ s, a little bit better than aver@@ age, but here's where it gets interest@@ ing.
If you put you put an ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive ad@@ min@@ . on the te@@ am, they get sign@@ ific@@ ant@@ ly bet@@ ter.
It's incredi@@ ble. You know, you look aroun@@ d, you go@@ , "Oh, that te@@ am@@ 's going to win@@ ."
You can just tell befor@@ eh@@ and. And why is that?
Because they have speci@@ al sk@@ ill@@ s of fac@@ ilit@@ ation.
They man@@ age the proc@@ ess, they understand the proc@@ ess.
And any te@@ am who man@@ ages and pa@@ ys close atten@@ tion to work will sign@@ ific@@ ant@@ ly impro@@ ve the te@@ am@@ 's per@@ for@@ man@@ ce.
Sp@@ ec@@ i@@ al@@ ized sk@@ ill@@ s and fac@@ ilit@@ ation sk@@ ill@@ s are the com@@ bin@@ ation that le@@ ad@@ s to str@@ ong succ@@ ess.
If you have 10 te@@ ams that ty@@ pic@@ ally per@@ form@@ , you'll get maybe six or so that have standing struc@@ tur@@ es.
And I tried something interest@@ ing.
I thought, let's up the an@@ te, on@@ ce.
So I o@@ ffer@@ ed a 10@@ ,000 d@@ ollar pri@@ ze of soft@@ ware to the w@@ inn@@ ing te@@ am.
So what do you think happened to these design stud@@ ent@@ s?
What was the resul@@ t?
Here's what happen@@ ed@@ : Not one te@@ am had a standing struc@@ ture.
If any@@ one had buil@@ t, say, a one in@@ ch struc@@ ture, they would have taken home the pri@@ z@@ e.
So, isn't that interest@@ ing@@ ? That high st@@ ak@@ es have a str@@ ong imp@@ ac@@ t.
We did the ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise ag@@ ain with the same stud@@ ents.
What do you think happened th@@ en?
So now they understand the val@@ ue of pro@@ to@@ typ@@ ing.
So the same te@@ am went from being the very wor@@ st to being am@@ ong the very bes@@ t.
They produc@@ ed the t@@ all@@ est struc@@ tures in the least amount of time.
So there's de@@ ep l@@ ess@@ ons for us about the nature of inc@@ enti@@ ves and succ@@ ess.
So, you might as@@ k@@ : Why would any@@ one actually spend time writ@@ ing a mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allow chall@@ en@@ ge@@ ?
And the reason is, I help create dig@@ ital tool@@ s and proc@@ ess@@ es to help te@@ ams build car@@ s and video gam@@ es and visu@@ al effec@@ ts.
And what the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allow chall@@ enge does is it hel@@ ps them iden@@ tif@@ y the hi@@ d@@ den ass@@ ump@@ tions.
Bec@@ ause, f@@ ran@@ kl@@ y, every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allo@@ w, doesn't it?
The chall@@ enge provi@@ des a shar@@ ed experi@@ ence, a common langu@@ age, a common st@@ ance to build the right pro@@ to@@ typ@@ e.
And so, this is the val@@ ue of the experi@@ ence, of this so simple ex@@ er@@ cis@@ e.
And those of you who are interested may want to go to Mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allo@@ w@@ Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge@@ .@@ com@@ .
It's a blo@@ g that you can look at how to build the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allo@@ w@@ s.
There's st@@ ep@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ ste@@ p in@@ struc@@ tions on this.
There are cra@@ z@@ y exampl@@ es from around the world of how people t@@ we@@ ak and ad@@ just the system.
There's world rec@@ or@@ ds that are on this as well.
And the fundament@@ al l@@ ess@@ on, I belie@@ ve, is that design tr@@ ul@@ y is a cont@@ act sp@@ or@@ t.
It dem@@ ands that we bring all of our sen@@ ses to the t@@ as@@ k, and that we ap@@ ply the very best of our think@@ ing, our feel@@ ing and our doing to the chall@@ enge that we have at h@@ and.
And some@@ tim@@ es, a little pro@@ to@@ ty@@ pe of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an "@@ u@@ h@@ -@@ oh@@ " moment to a "@@ ta@@ -@@ da@@ " mom@@ ent.
And that can make a big differ@@ ence.
Thank you very much.
Let's pre@@ tend right here we have a mach@@ ine.
A big mach@@ ine, a cool@@ , TED@@ -@@ ish mach@@ ine, and it's a time mach@@ ine.
And everyone in this room has to get into it.
And you can go back@@ war@@ ds, you can go for@@ war@@ d@@ s@@ ; you cannot sta@@ y where you are.
And I w@@ on@@ der what you@@ 'd ch@@ oo@@ se, because I've been as@@ king my fri@@ ends this question a lot lat@@ ely and they all want to go bac@@ k.
I don't know. They want to go back before there were autom@@ ob@@ il@@ es or T@@ wit@@ ter or "@@ American I@@ d@@ ol@@ ."
I don't know.
I'm con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed that there's some sort of pul@@ l to no@@ st@@ al@@ gi@@ a, to wis@@ h@@ ful think@@ ing.
And I understand that.
I'm not part of that cro@@ w@@ d, I have to sa@@ y.
I don't want to go back, and it's not because I'm adv@@ ent@@ ur@@ ous.
It's because possi@@ bili@@ ties on this plan@@ et, they don't go back, they go for@@ war@@ d.
So I want to get in the mach@@ ine, and I want to go for@@ war@@ d.
This is the great@@ est time there's ever been on this planet by any meas@@ ure that you wis@@ h to ch@@ oo@@ se@@ : heal@@ th, we@@ al@@ th, mo@@ bili@@ ty, opportun@@ ity, dec@@ lin@@ ing rat@@ es of diseas@@ e ...
There's never been a time like this.
My great@@ -@@ gr@@ and@@ par@@ ents di@@ ed, all of them, by the time they were 60@@ .
My gr@@ and@@ par@@ ents p@@ us@@ h@@ ed that number to 7@@ 0@@ .
My par@@ ents are clos@@ ing in on 8@@ 0@@ .
So there better be a n@@ ine at the beginning of my de@@ ath num@@ ber@@ .
But it's not even about people like us, because this is a big@@ ger deal than that.
A ki@@ d bor@@ n in New D@@ el@@ h@@ i today can exp@@ ect to live as long as the rich@@ est man in the world did 100 years ago.
Th@@ ink about that, it's an incredible fac@@ t.
And why is it tru@@ e?
S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x@@ . S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x kill@@ ed billi@@ ons of people on this plan@@ et.
It res@@ ha@@ p@@ ed the demo@@ gra@@ ph@@ y of the g@@ lo@@ be in a way that no war ever h@@ as.
It's g@@ one. It's v@@ an@@ is@@ he@@ d.
We v@@ an@@ qu@@ ish@@ ed it. P@@ u@@ ff@@ .
In the r@@ ich world, diseas@@ es that thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed milli@@ ons of us just a gener@@ ation ago no longer ex@@ ist, har@@ d@@ ly.
Di@@ ph@@ ther@@ i@@ a, ru@@ b@@ ell@@ a, poli@@ o ...
does any@@ one even know what those things ar@@ e?
V@@ acc@@ in@@ es, mo@@ dern medic@@ ine, our ability to fe@@ ed billi@@ ons of people, those are tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s of the scienti@@ fic me@@ tho@@ d.
And to my min@@ d, the scienti@@ fic me@@ tho@@ d -- trying stuff out, seeing if it work@@ s, chang@@ ing it when it doesn't -- is one of the great ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ments of human@@ ity.
So that's the good new@@ s.
Un@@ fortun@@ at@@ ely, that's all the good news because there are some other problem@@ s, and they've been men@@ tion@@ ed many tim@@ es.
And one of them is that des@@ p@@ ite all our ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ment@@ s, a billion people go to bed h@@ ung@@ ry in this world every day.
That num@@ ber@@ 's ris@@ ing, and it's ris@@ ing really ra@@ p@@ id@@ ly, and it's dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul@@ .
And not only that, we've used our imagin@@ ation to th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly tr@@ as@@ h this glob@@ e.
Po@@ t@@ able wat@@ er, ar@@ able lan@@ d, ra@@ in@@ for@@ est@@ s, o@@ il@@ , g@@ as@@ : they're going a@@ way, and they're going away so@@ on, and un@@ less we innov@@ ate our way out of this m@@ ess, we're going away to@@ o.
So the question is@@ : Can we do that? And I think we can@@ .
I think it's clear that we can make food that will fe@@ ed billi@@ ons of people without ra@@ p@@ ing the land that they live on.
I think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also des@@ tro@@ y it.
I really do believe that, and, no@@ , it ain@@ 't wis@@ h@@ ful think@@ ing.
But here's the thing that ke@@ ep@@ s me up at n@@ ight -- one of the things that ke@@ ep@@ s me up at nigh@@ t: We've never needed progr@@ ess in science more than we need it right now. N@@ ever@@ .
And we've also never been in a pos@@ ition to de@@ plo@@ y it pro@@ per@@ ly in the way that we can today.
We're on the ver@@ ge of amaz@@ ing, amazing ev@@ ents in many fiel@@ ds, and yet I actually think we@@ 'd have to go back hundre@@ ds, 300 years, before the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment, to find a time when we b@@ at@@ tl@@ ed progr@@ ess, when we f@@ ought about these things more v@@ ig@@ or@@ ous@@ ly, on more fron@@ ts, than we do now.
People w@@ ra@@ p them@@ selves in their belie@@ f@@ s, and they do it so ti@@ gh@@ tly that you can't set them fre@@ e.
Not even the tr@@ ut@@ h will set them fre@@ e.
And, li@@ st@@ en, every@@ on@@ e's ent@@ it@@ led to their op@@ in@@ i@@ on@@ ; they're even ent@@ it@@ led to their op@@ in@@ ion about progr@@ ess.
But you know what you're not ent@@ it@@ led to@@ ?
You're not ent@@ it@@ led to your own fac@@ ts. S@@ or@@ r@@ y, you're no@@ t.
And this took me a@@ while to figure out.
Ab@@ out a dec@@ ade ago, I wrote a story about v@@ acc@@ ines for The New Yor@@ k@@ er. A little story.
And I was amaz@@ ed to find op@@ positi@@ on@@ : op@@ pos@@ ition to what is, after all, the most effec@@ tive public health meas@@ ure in human histor@@ y.
I didn't know what to do, so I just did what I do@@ : I wrote a story and I mo@@ ved on.
And so@@ on after that, I wrote a story about gen@@ e@@ tic@@ ally engine@@ er@@ ed foo@@ d.
S@@ ame thing, only big@@ ger@@ .
People were going cra@@ z@@ y.
So I wrote a story about that to@@ o, and I couldn't understand why people thought this was "@@ F@@ ran@@ k@@ en@@ foo@@ d@@ s@@ ," why they thought moving molec@@ ul@@ es around in a spec@@ if@@ ic, rather than a ha@@ p@@ ha@@ z@@ ard way, was tr@@ es@@ pas@@ sing on nat@@ ure@@ 's gro@@ und.
Bu@@ t, you know, I do what I do. I wrote the stor@@ y, I mo@@ ved on.
I mean, I'm a jour@@ n@@ al@@ ist.
We typ@@ e, we fil@@ e, we go to d@@ inn@@ er. It's fin@@ e.
But these stories bo@@ ther@@ ed me, and I couldn't figure out wh@@ y, and ev@@ ent@@ ually I di@@ d.
And that's because those f@@ an@@ ati@@ c@@ s that were dri@@ ving me cra@@ z@@ y wer@@ en't actually f@@ an@@ ati@@ c@@ s at all.
They were though@@ t@@ ful people, educ@@ ated people, dec@@ ent people.
They were exactly like the people in this room@@ .
And it just dist@@ ur@@ bed me so much.
But then I thought, you know, let's be hon@@ es@@ t.
We're at a point in this world where we don't have the same relation@@ ship to progr@@ ess that we used to.
We talk about it am@@ bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ly.
We talk about it in ir@@ on@@ ic terms with little qu@@ o@@ tes around it@@ : "@@ progr@@ ess@@ ."
Okay, there are reas@@ ons for that, and I think we know what those reas@@ ons are.
We've lo@@ st fa@@ ith in institu@@ tions, in auth@@ or@@ ity, and sometimes in science it@@ self, and there's no reason we sh@@ ouldn't ha@@ ve.
You can just say a few nam@@ es and people will under@@ stan@@ d.
C@@ her@@ no@@ b@@ y@@ l, B@@ hop@@ al, the Ch@@ all@@ eng@@ er, Vi@@ ox@@ x@@ , we@@ ap@@ ons of mas@@ s des@@ tru@@ c@@ tion, h@@ ang@@ ing ch@@ ad@@ s.
You know, you can ch@@ oo@@ se your li@@ st.
There are ques@@ tions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right, so be sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ al.
A@@ s@@ k ques@@ tions, dem@@ and pro@@ of, dem@@ and evi@@ den@@ ce.
D@@ on't take anything for gr@@ an@@ ted.
But here's the thing@@ : When you get pro@@ of, you need to acc@@ ept the pro@@ of, and we're not that good at doing that.
And the reason that I can say that is because we're now in an ep@@ ide@@ m@@ ic of fe@@ ar like one I've never seen and hope never to see again.
Ab@@ out 12 years ago, there was a story publi@@ sh@@ ed, a hor@@ ri@@ ble stor@@ y, that lin@@ ked the ep@@ ide@@ m@@ ic of au@@ t@@ is@@ m to the meas@@ l@@ es, m@@ um@@ ps and ru@@ b@@ ell@@ a v@@ acc@@ ine sho@@ t.
Ver@@ y sc@@ ar@@ y.
T@@ ons of stu@@ dies were done to see if this was tru@@ e.
T@@ ons of stu@@ dies should have been don@@ e; it's a seri@@ ous issu@@ e.
The data came bac@@ k.
The data came back from the United Stat@@ es, from En@@ gl@@ and, from S@@ we@@ den, from C@@ an@@ a@@ da, and it was all the sam@@ e: no cor@@ rel@@ ation, no connec@@ tion, n@@ one at all.
It doesn't mat@@ ter. It doesn't matter because we believe an@@ ec@@ do@@ t@@ es, we believe what we see, what we think we see, what makes us feel re@@ al.
We don't believe a b@@ unch of doc@@ um@@ ents from a government off@@ ici@@ al gi@@ ving us dat@@ a, and I do understand that, I think we all do.
But you know what@@ ?
The res@@ ult of that has been dis@@ a@@ str@@ ous.
Dis@@ a@@ str@@ ous because here's a fac@@ t: The United St@@ ates is one of the only countries in the world where the v@@ acc@@ ine rate for meas@@ les is going down.
That is dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul@@ , and we should be ash@@ am@@ ed of our@@ sel@@ ves.
It's hor@@ ri@@ ble.
What kind of a thing happened that we could do that?
Now, I understand it. I do understand it.
Bec@@ ause, did any@@ one have meas@@ les her@@ e?
H@@ as one person in this audi@@ ence ever seen someone die of meas@@ l@@ es?
Do@@ es@@ n't happen very much.
Do@@ es@@ n't happen in this country at all, but it happened 1@@ 60@@ ,000 times in the world last year.
That's a lot of de@@ ath of meas@@ les -- 20 an hour@@ .
But since it didn't happen here, we can put it out of our min@@ ds, and people like J@@ enn@@ y Mc@@ Car@@ th@@ y can go around pre@@ ach@@ ing mes@@ sag@@ es of fe@@ ar and illi@@ ter@@ ac@@ y from plat@@ form@@ s like "@@ O@@ pra@@ h@@ " and "@@ L@@ ar@@ ry K@@ ing Li@@ v@@ e."
And they can do it because they don't lin@@ k caus@@ ation and cor@@ rel@@ ation.
They don't understand that these things se@@ em the sam@@ e, but they're almost never the sam@@ e.
And it's something we need to lear@@ n, and we need to learn it really so@@ on.
This guy was a her@@ o, J@@ on@@ as S@@ al@@ k.
He took one of the wor@@ st sc@@ our@@ g@@ es of man@@ kind away from us.
N@@ o f@@ ear@@ , no ag@@ on@@ y. Po@@ li@@ o -- pu@@ ff@@ , g@@ one.
That guy in the m@@ idd@@ le, not so much.
H@@ is name is Pau@@ l O@@ ff@@ it.
He just develop@@ ed a ro@@ ta@@ vi@@ ru@@ s v@@ acc@@ ine with a b@@ unch of other people.
It@@ 'll sa@@ ve the lives of 4@@ 00 to 5@@ 00@@ ,000 kids in the developing world every year.
P@@ re@@ tt@@ y goo@@ d, right?
Well, it's goo@@ d, exc@@ ept that Pau@@ l goes around talking about v@@ acc@@ ines and says how valu@@ able they are and that people ought to just stop the wh@@ in@@ ing.
And he actually says it that way.
So, Pau@@ l@@ 's a ter@@ r@@ or@@ ist.
When Pau@@ l spe@@ ak@@ s in a public hear@@ ing, he can't tes@@ tif@@ y without ar@@ m@@ ed gu@@ ar@@ ds.
He gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school@@ .
And wh@@ y? Because Pau@@ l made a v@@ acc@@ ine.
I don't need to say this, but v@@ acc@@ ines are essenti@@ al.
You take them a@@ way, diseas@@ e comes back, hor@@ ri@@ ble diseas@@ es. And that's happen@@ ing.
We have meas@@ les in this country now.
And it's getting wor@@ se, and pretty so@@ on kids are going to die of it ag@@ ain because it's just a num@@ bers gam@@ e.
And they're not just going to die of meas@@ l@@ es.
What about poli@@ o@@ ? Let's have that. Why no@@ t?
A col@@ le@@ ge clas@@ sm@@ ate of m@@ ine wrote me a couple week@@ s ago and said she thought I was a little stri@@ den@@ t.
N@@ o on@@ e's ever said that befor@@ e.
She wasn't going to v@@ acc@@ in@@ ate her ki@@ d against poli@@ o, no way.
F@@ ine.
Wh@@ y? Because we don't have poli@@ o. And you know what@@ ?
We didn't have poli@@ o in this country y@@ es@@ ter@@ day.
To@@ day, I don't know, maybe a guy got on a plan@@ e in L@@ ag@@ os this mor@@ n@@ ing, and he's fl@@ ying to L@@ A@@ X@@ , right now he's over O@@ hi@@ o.
And he's going to land in a couple of hour@@ s, he's going to r@@ ent a car@@ , and he's going to come to L@@ ong Be@@ ach@@ , and he's going to atten@@ d one of these f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous TED d@@ inn@@ ers ton@@ igh@@ t.
And he doesn't know that he's inf@@ ected with a par@@ aly@@ tic diseas@@ e, and we don't ei@@ ther because that's the way the world work@@ s.
That's the planet we live on. D@@ on't pre@@ tend it is@@ n@@ '@@ t.
Now, we love to w@@ ra@@ p our@@ selves in li@@ es. We love to do it.
Every@@ one take their v@@ it@@ am@@ ins this mor@@ n@@ ing@@ ?
E@@ ch@@ in@@ ac@@ e@@ a, a little anti@@ ox@@ id@@ ant to get you go@@ ing.
I know you did because half of Americ@@ ans do every day.
They take the stuff@@ , and they take al@@ tern@@ ative medic@@ in@@ es, and it doesn't matter how often we find out that they're us@@ el@@ ess.
The data says it all the time.
They dar@@ ken your ur@@ ine. They almost never do more than that.
It's ok@@ a@@ y, you want to pay 2@@ 8 billion dollars for dar@@ k ur@@ in@@ e?
I'm tot@@ ally with you.
Dar@@ k ur@@ ine. Dar@@ k.
Why do we do that? Why do we do that?
Well, I think I under@@ st@@ and, we hat@@ e Bi@@ g P@@ har@@ ma@@ .
We hat@@ e Bi@@ g Go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment. We don't tr@@ ust the M@@ an.
And we sh@@ oul@@ dn@@ '@@ t: Our health care system su@@ ck@@ s.
It's c@@ ru@@ el to milli@@ ons of people.
It's absolutely ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing@@ ly c@@ old and s@@ oul@@ -@@ ben@@ ding to those of us who can even aff@@ ord it.
So we run away from it, and where do we run@@ ?
We lea@@ p into the ar@@ ms of Bi@@ g P@@ l@@ ac@@ eb@@ o.
That's fantast@@ ic. I love Bi@@ g P@@ l@@ ac@@ eb@@ o.
Bu@@ t, you know, it's really a seri@@ ous thing because this stuff is cra@@ p, and we spend billi@@ ons of dollars on it.
And I have all sor@@ ts of little pro@@ ps here.
N@@ one of it ... g@@ ink@@ go@@ , fr@@ au@@ d@@ ; ech@@ in@@ ac@@ e@@ a, fr@@ au@@ d@@ ; ac@@ a@@ i -- I don't even know what that is but we're sp@@ end@@ ing billi@@ ons of dollars on it -- it's fr@@ au@@ d.
And you know what@@ ? When I say this stuff@@ , people scre@@ am at me, and they say, "What do you car@@ e? L@@ et people do what they want to do.
It makes them feel goo@@ d@@ ."
And you know what@@ ? You're wr@@ ong@@ .
Because I don't care if it's the sec@@ re@@ t@@ ary of H@@ H@@ S who's say@@ ing, "H@@ m@@ m, I'm not going to take the evi@@ dence of my exper@@ ts on m@@ am@@ mo@@ gr@@ am@@ s@@ ," or some canc@@ er qu@@ ack who wan@@ ts to tre@@ at his pati@@ ent with co@@ ff@@ e@@ e en@@ em@@ as.
When you start down the ro@@ ad where belie@@ f and mag@@ ic re@@ place evi@@ dence and sci@@ ence, you end up in a place you don't want to be.
You end up in Th@@ ab@@ o M@@ be@@ k@@ i South Afric@@ a.
He kill@@ ed 4@@ 00@@ ,000 of his people by in@@ si@@ st@@ ing that be@@ et@@ ro@@ o@@ t, gar@@ li@@ c and l@@ em@@ on oil were much more effec@@ tive than the anti@@ re@@ tro@@ vir@@ al dru@@ gs we know can s@@ low the course of AID@@ S.
H@@ und@@ re@@ ds of thousands of need@@ less de@@ ath@@ s in a country that has been pl@@ ag@@ u@@ ed wor@@ se than any other by this diseas@@ e.
P@@ le@@ as@@ e, don't tell me there are no con@@ sequ@@ ences to these things.
There are. There always are.
Now, the most min@@ d@@ less ep@@ ide@@ m@@ ic we're in the middle of right now is this ab@@ sur@@ d b@@ att@@ le between pro@@ p@@ on@@ ents of gen@@ e@@ tic@@ ally engine@@ er@@ ed food and the organ@@ ic el@@ it@@ e.
It's an i@@ di@@ o@@ tic de@@ b@@ ate. It has to st@@ op@@ .
It's a de@@ b@@ ate about wor@@ ds, about met@@ ap@@ hor@@ s.
It's ide@@ olog@@ y, it's not sci@@ ence.
E@@ very single thing we e@@ at, every gra@@ in of ri@@ ce, every sp@@ ri@@ g of par@@ s@@ le@@ y, every Br@@ us@@ sel@@ s spr@@ out has been mo@@ di@@ fi@@ ed by man@@ .
You know, there wer@@ en't t@@ anger@@ ines in the gar@@ den of E@@ d@@ en.
There wasn't any can@@ tal@@ ou@@ p@@ e. There wer@@ en't Christ@@ m@@ as tre@@ es. We made it all.
We made it over the last 1@@ 1@@ ,000 years.
And some of it work@@ ed, and some of it di@@ dn@@ '@@ t.
We got ri@@ d of the stuff that di@@ dn@@ '@@ t.
Now we can do it in a more pre@@ c@@ ise way -- and there are ris@@ k@@ s, absolutely -- but we can put something like v@@ it@@ am@@ in A into ri@@ ce, and that stuff can help milli@@ ons of people, milli@@ ons of people, pro@@ long their li@@ ves.
You don't want to do that?
I have to say, I don't understand it.
We objec@@ t to gen@@ e@@ tic@@ ally engine@@ er@@ ed foo@@ d.
Why do we do that?
Well, the things I con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly hear ar@@ e: To@@ o many chem@@ ic@@ als, p@@ es@@ tici@@ d@@ es, hor@@ mon@@ es, mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ ture, we don't want gi@@ ant fiel@@ ds of the same thing, that's wr@@ ong@@ .
We don't compan@@ ies pat@@ ent@@ ing life.
We don't want compan@@ ies ow@@ ning se@@ ed@@ s.
And you know what my respon@@ se to all of that is@@ ?
Y@@ es, you're right. Let's fi@@ x it.
It's tru@@ e, we've got a huge food problem@@ , but this isn't sci@@ ence.
This has nothing to do with sci@@ ence.
It's la@@ w, it's mor@@ al@@ ity, it's pat@@ ent stuff@@ .
You know science isn't a compan@@ y.
It's not a countr@@ y.
It's not even an ide@@ a@@ ; it's a proc@@ ess.
It's a proc@@ ess, and sometimes it works and sometimes it do@@ es@@ n@@ '@@ t, but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we're af@@ ra@@ i@@ d, is really very de@@ a@@ den@@ ing, and it's pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing milli@@ ons of people from pro@@ sp@@ er@@ ing.
You know, in the next 50 years we're going to have to grow 7@@ 0 percent more food than we do right now, 7@@ 0 perc@@ ent.
This inv@@ est@@ ment in Africa over the last 30 years.
Dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul@@ . Dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul@@ .
They need it, and we're not gi@@ ving it to them.
And wh@@ y? Gen@@ e@@ tic@@ ally engine@@ er@@ ed foo@@ d.
We don't want to enc@@ our@@ age people to e@@ at that ro@@ tten stuff@@ , like cas@@ sa@@ v@@ a for inst@@ anc@@ e.
C@@ as@@ sa@@ v@@ a@@ 's something that half a billion people e@@ at.
It's kind of like a po@@ t@@ at@@ o.
It's just a b@@ unch of cal@@ ori@@ es. It su@@ ck@@ s.
It doesn't have n@@ ut@@ ri@@ ents, it doesn't have prot@@ ein@@ , and scienti@@ sts are engine@@ er@@ ing all of that into it right now.
And then people would be able to e@@ at it and they@@ 'd be able to not go bl@@ in@@ d.
They wouldn't star@@ ve, and you know what@@ ?
That would be n@@ ic@@ e. It wouldn't be C@@ he@@ z P@@ an@@ is@@ se, but it would be n@@ ic@@ e.
And all I can say about this is@@ : Why are we f@@ igh@@ ting it?
I mean, let's ask our@@ sel@@ ves@@ : Why are we f@@ igh@@ ting it?
Because we don't want to move gen@@ es ar@@ o@@ und@@ ?
This is about moving gen@@ es aroun@@ d. It's not about chem@@ ic@@ als.
It's not about our ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous passi@@ on for hor@@ mon@@ es, our in@@ si@@ st@@ ence on having big@@ ger foo@@ d, better foo@@ d, sing@@ ular foo@@ d.
This isn't about R@@ ice K@@ ris@@ pi@@ es, this is about ke@@ ep@@ ing people ali@@ ve, and it's about time we started to understand what that mean@@ t.
Bec@@ ause, you know some@@ thing@@ ?
If we don@@ '@@ t, if we contin@@ ue to act the way we're ac@@ t@@ ing, we're gu@@ il@@ ty of something that I don't think we want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of@@ : high@@ -@@ te@@ ch col@@ on@@ i@@ alis@@ m.
There's no other way to descri@@ be what's going on here.
It's self@@ is@@ h, it's u@@ gl@@ y, it's ben@@ e@@ ath us, and we really have to stop it.
So after this amaz@@ ing@@ ly fu@@ n con@@ vers@@ ation, you might want to say, "@@ So, you still want to get in this ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous time mach@@ ine and go for@@ war@@ d@@ ?"
Ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ el@@ y. Ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely, I do.
It's stu@@ ck in the pres@@ ent right now, but we have an amazing opportun@@ ity.
We can set that time mach@@ ine on anything we wan@@ t.
We can move it where we want to move it, and we're going to move it where we want to move it.
We have to have these con@@ vers@@ ations and we have to think, but when we get in the time mach@@ ine and we go ah@@ e@@ ad, we're going to be happy we do.
I know that we c@@ an, and as far as I'm con@@ cer@@ ne@@ d, that's something the world needs right now.
Thank you.
One day, L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es Tim@@ es col@@ um@@ n@@ ist Ste@@ ve Lo@@ pe@@ z was wal@@ king along the stre@@ ets of dow@@ n@@ to@@ wn L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es when he heard beautiful mus@@ ic.
And the s@@ ource was a man, an Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American man, char@@ m@@ ing, ru@@ g@@ ge@@ d, hom@@ el@@ ess, pla@@ ying a vi@@ o@@ li@@ n that only had two str@@ ing@@ s.
And I'm tell@@ ing a story that many of you know, because Ste@@ v@@ e's col@@ um@@ ns became the bas@@ is for a boo@@ k, which was turned into a mo@@ vi@@ e, with Ro@@ bert Do@@ w@@ ne@@ y J@@ r. ac@@ ting as Ste@@ ve Lo@@ pe@@ z@@ , and Jam@@ ie Fo@@ x@@ x as N@@ ath@@ an@@ ie@@ l An@@ th@@ on@@ y A@@ y@@ ers, the Ju@@ illi@@ ar@@ d-@@ train@@ ed d@@ ou@@ ble b@@ ass@@ ist who@@ se pro@@ mis@@ ing car@@ e@@ er was cut sh@@ ort by a trag@@ ic aff@@ lic@@ tion with par@@ an@@ o@@ id sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ i@@ a.
N@@ ath@@ an@@ ie@@ l dro@@ pped out of Ju@@ illi@@ ar@@ d, he su@@ ffer@@ ed a compl@@ ete bre@@ ak@@ down, and 30 years lat@@ er he was living hom@@ el@@ ess on the stre@@ ets of S@@ ki@@ d Ro@@ w in dow@@ n@@ to@@ wn L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es.
I enc@@ our@@ age all of you to read Ste@@ v@@ e's book or to wat@@ ch the mov@@ ie to understand not only the beautiful b@@ ond that form@@ ed between these two m@@ en, but how music help@@ ed sha@@ pe that b@@ on@@ d, and ul@@ tim@@ ately was in@@ strum@@ ent@@ al -- if you'll par@@ d@@ on the pu@@ n -- in help@@ ing N@@ ath@@ an@@ ie@@ l get off the stre@@ et@@ s.
I met M@@ r. A@@ y@@ ers in 200@@ 8@@ , two years ago, at Wal@@ t Dis@@ ne@@ y Con@@ c@@ ert H@@ all.
He had just heard a per@@ for@@ man@@ ce of Be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven@@ 's Fir@@ st and F@@ our@@ th sy@@ m@@ ph@@ on@@ ies, and came back@@ st@@ age and in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed him@@ self.
He was spe@@ a@@ king in a very jo@@ vi@@ al and gre@@ g@@ ari@@ ous way about Y@@ o-@@ Y@@ o M@@ a and H@@ ill@@ ary C@@ lin@@ ton and how the Do@@ d@@ ger@@ s were never going to make the World S@@ eri@@ es, all because of the tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous first vi@@ o@@ li@@ n pas@@ sage work in the last mov@@ ement of Be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven@@ 's F@@ our@@ th Sy@@ m@@ ph@@ on@@ y.
And we got talking about mus@@ ic, and I got an em@@ a@@ il from Ste@@ ve a few days lat@@ er saying that N@@ ath@@ an@@ ie@@ l was interested in a vi@@ o@@ li@@ n l@@ ess@@ on with me.
Now, I should men@@ tion that N@@ ath@@ an@@ ie@@ l ref@@ uses tre@@ at@@ ment because when he was tre@@ ated it was with sho@@ ck ther@@ ap@@ y and Th@@ or@@ az@@ ine and hand@@ cu@@ ff@@ s, and that sc@@ ar has sta@@ y@@ ed with him for his entire life.
But as a res@@ ult now, he is pr@@ one to these sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic ep@@ is@@ o@@ d@@ es, the wor@@ st of which can man@@ if@@ est them@@ selves as him expl@@ o@@ ding and then dis@@ appear@@ ing for da@@ ys, w@@ ander@@ ing the stre@@ ets of S@@ ki@@ d Ro@@ w, ex@@ posed to its hor@@ r@@ or@@ s, with the tor@@ ment of his own mind un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed up@@ on him@@ .
And N@@ ath@@ an@@ ie@@ l was in such a state of ag@@ it@@ ation when we started our first l@@ ess@@ on at Wal@@ t Dis@@ ne@@ y Con@@ c@@ ert H@@ all -- he had a kind of man@@ ic gl@@ in@@ t in his ey@@ es, he was lo@@ st.
And he was talking about inv@@ isi@@ ble de@@ mon@@ s and s@@ mo@@ k@@ e, and how someone was po@@ is@@ on@@ ing him in his s@@ le@@ ep@@ .
And I was af@@ ra@@ i@@ d, not for my@@ self, but I was af@@ ra@@ id that I was going to lose him@@ , that he was going to sin@@ k into one of his stat@@ es, and that I would ru@@ in his relation@@ ship with the vi@@ o@@ li@@ n if I started talking about sc@@ ales and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ os and other exc@@ iting form@@ s of di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic vi@@ o@@ li@@ n pe@@ d@@ ag@@ og@@ y.
So, I just started play@@ ing.
And I play@@ ed the first mov@@ ement of the Be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven Vi@@ o@@ li@@ n Con@@ cer@@ to.
And as I play@@ ed, I under@@ st@@ ood that there was a pro@@ found change oc@@ curr@@ ing in N@@ ath@@ an@@ iel@@ 's ey@@ es.
It was as if he was in the gri@@ p of some inv@@ isi@@ ble ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ eu@@ tic@@ al, a chem@@ ical re@@ ac@@ tion, for which my pla@@ ying the music was its cat@@ aly@@ st.
And N@@ ath@@ an@@ iel@@ 's man@@ ic r@@ age was transform@@ ed into under@@ stand@@ ing, a qu@@ ie@@ t cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity and gr@@ ac@@ e.
And in a mir@@ ac@@ le, he lif@@ ted his own vi@@ o@@ li@@ n and he started play@@ ing, by ear@@ , certain s@@ ni@@ pp@@ ets of vi@@ o@@ li@@ n con@@ cer@@ to@@ s which he then asked me to compl@@ ete -- M@@ end@@ el@@ s@@ so@@ h@@ n, T@@ ch@@ a@@ ik@@ o@@ v@@ sk@@ y, Si@@ bel@@ i@@ us.
And we started talking about mus@@ ic, from B@@ ach to Be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven and Bra@@ h@@ m@@ s, B@@ ru@@ ck@@ n@@ er, all the B@@ '@@ s, from Bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k, all the way up to E@@ sa@@ -@@ P@@ ek@@ k@@ a S@@ al@@ on@@ en.
And I under@@ st@@ ood that he not only had an enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedi@@ c knowle@@ dge of mus@@ ic, but he rel@@ ated to this music at a person@@ al level@@ .
He spo@@ ke about it with the kind of passi@@ on and under@@ standing that I share with my col@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es in the L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es Ph@@ il@@ har@@ mon@@ ic.
And through pla@@ ying music and talking about mus@@ ic, this man had transform@@ ed from the par@@ an@@ o@@ i@@ d, dist@@ ur@@ bed man that had just come from wal@@ king the stre@@ ets of dow@@ n@@ to@@ wn L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es to the char@@ m@@ ing, er@@ u@@ d@@ it@@ e, bri@@ lli@@ an@@ t, Ju@@ illi@@ ar@@ d-@@ train@@ ed mus@@ ici@@ an.
Mus@@ ic is medic@@ ine. Mus@@ ic chang@@ es us.
And for N@@ ath@@ an@@ iel@@ , music is s@@ an@@ ity.
Because music allo@@ ws him to take his though@@ ts and del@@ usi@@ ons and sha@@ pe them through his imagin@@ ation and his cre@@ ativ@@ ity, into real@@ ity.
And that is an es@@ cap@@ e from his tor@@ ment@@ ed stat@@ e.
And I under@@ st@@ ood that this was the very ess@@ ence of ar@@ t.
This was the very reason why we made mus@@ ic, that we take something that exist@@ s within all of us at our very fundament@@ al cor@@ e, our emo@@ tions, and through our arti@@ st@@ ic l@@ en@@ s, through our cre@@ ativ@@ ity, we're able to sha@@ pe those emo@@ tions into real@@ ity.
And the real@@ ity of that ex@@ pres@@ sion re@@ ach@@ es all of us and mo@@ ves us, in@@ spir@@ es and un@@ it@@ es us.
And for N@@ ath@@ an@@ iel@@ , music brought him back into a fol@@ d of friend@@ s.
The re@@ dem@@ p@@ tive power of music brought him back into a family of mus@@ ici@@ ans that under@@ st@@ ood him@@ , that recogn@@ ized his tal@@ ents and resp@@ ected him@@ .
And I will always make music with N@@ ath@@ an@@ iel@@ , whether we're at Wal@@ t Dis@@ ne@@ y Con@@ c@@ ert H@@ all or on S@@ ki@@ d Ro@@ w, because he re@@ min@@ ds me why I became a mus@@ ici@@ an.
Thank you.
Br@@ un@@ o Gi@@ us@@ s@@ an@@ i@@ : Thank you. Th@@ ank@@ s.
Ro@@ bert G@@ up@@ ta@@ .
Ro@@ bert G@@ up@@ ta@@ : I'm going to play something that I sh@@ am@@ el@@ ess@@ ly st@@ ole from c@@ elli@@ st@@ s.
So, pleas@@ e for@@ give me.
I'm J@@ an@@ e Mc@@ G@@ on@@ ig@@ al. I'm a game design@@ er.
I've been making gam@@ es on@@ line now for 10 years, and my go@@ al for the next dec@@ ade is to try to make it as eas@@ y to sa@@ ve the world in real life as it is to sa@@ ve the world in on@@ line gam@@ es.
Now, I have a pl@@ an for this, and it ent@@ ail@@ s con@@ v@@ inc@@ ing more people, inclu@@ ding all of you, to spend more time pla@@ ying big@@ ger and better gam@@ es.
R@@ ight now we spend three billion hours a we@@ ek pla@@ ying on@@ line gam@@ es.
Some of you might be think@@ ing, "@@ That's a lot of time to spend pla@@ ying gam@@ es.
Ma@@ ybe too much time, consi@@ der@@ ing how many ur@@ gen@@ t problems we have to sol@@ ve in the real world@@ ."
But actually, acc@@ ord@@ ing to my research at the Institu@@ te for the F@@ ut@@ ure, actually the op@@ pos@@ ite is tru@@ e.
Th@@ re@@ e billion hours a we@@ ek is not ne@@ ar@@ ly enough game play to sol@@ ve the world's most ur@@ gen@@ t problem@@ s.
In fact, I believe that if we want to survi@@ ve the next centur@@ y on this plan@@ et, we need to incre@@ ase that tot@@ al dr@@ am@@ ati@@ call@@ y.
I've cal@@ cul@@ ated the tot@@ al we need at 2@@ 1 billion hours of game play every week@@ .
So, that's probably a bit of a co@@ unter@@ -@@ in@@ tu@@ itive ide@@ a, so I'll say it again, let it sin@@ k in@@ : If we want to sol@@ ve problems like h@@ ung@@ er, po@@ ver@@ ty, climate chang@@ e, global conf@@ lic@@ t, o@@ bes@@ ity, I believe that we need to as@@ p@@ ire to play gam@@ es on@@ line for at least 2@@ 1 billion hours a week@@ , by the end of the next dec@@ ad@@ e.
No@@ . I'm seri@@ ous. I am.
Here's wh@@ y.
This picture pretty much sum@@ s up why I think gam@@ es are so essenti@@ al to the future survi@@ v@@ al of the human speci@@ es. Tr@@ ul@@ y.
This is a p@@ ort@@ ra@@ it by photograph@@ er P@@ hi@@ l T@@ ol@@ ed@@ an@@ o.
He wanted to cap@@ ture the emo@@ tion of gam@@ ing, so he set up a camer@@ a in front of gam@@ ers while they were play@@ ing.
And this is a clas@@ si@@ c gam@@ ing emo@@ tion.
Now, if you're not a gam@@ er, you might mis@@ s some of the nu@@ ance in this pho@@ to.
You probably see the sense of ur@@ gen@@ c@@ y, a little bit of f@@ ear@@ , but inten@@ se con@@ centr@@ ation, de@@ ep@@ , de@@ ep foc@@ us on t@@ ac@@ kl@@ ing a really diffic@@ ult problem.
If you are a gam@@ er, you will no@@ tice a few nu@@ anc@@ es her@@ e: the cr@@ ink@@ le of the ey@@ es up, and around the m@@ outh is a s@@ ign of op@@ tim@@ is@@ m, and the ey@@ eb@@ ro@@ ws up is sur@@ pris@@ e.
This is a gam@@ er who's on the ver@@ ge of something called an "@@ ep@@ ic win@@ ."
Oh, you've heard of that.
OK, goo@@ d, so we have some gam@@ ers am@@ ong us.
An ep@@ ic w@@ in is an out@@ come that is so extra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily positi@@ ve, you had no idea it was even possible until you achie@@ ved it.
It was almost be@@ y@@ ond the th@@ res@@ hold of imagin@@ ation, and when you get there, you're sho@@ ck@@ ed to dis@@ cover what you're tr@@ ul@@ y cap@@ able of@@ .
That's an ep@@ ic win@@ .
This is a gam@@ er on the ver@@ ge of an ep@@ ic win@@ .
And this is the face that we need to see on milli@@ ons of problem@@ -@@ sol@@ ver@@ s all over the world as we try to t@@ ack@@ le the ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les of the next centur@@ y -- the face of someone wh@@ o, against all o@@ d@@ ds, is on the ver@@ ge of an ep@@ ic win@@ .
Now, un@@ fortun@@ ately this is more of the face that we see in every@@ day life now as we try to t@@ ack@@ le ur@@ gen@@ t problem@@ s.
This is what I call the "@@ I'm Not G@@ ood At Li@@ fe@@ " fac@@ e.
This is actually me making it. Can you se@@ e? Y@@ es. G@@ oo@@ d.
This is me making the "@@ I'm Not G@@ ood At Li@@ fe@@ " fac@@ e.
This is a piece of gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i in my old neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od in B@@ er@@ k@@ el@@ e@@ y, C@@ aliforni@@ a, where I did my Ph@@ D on why we're better in gam@@ es than we are in real life.
And this is a problem that a lot of gam@@ ers ha@@ ve.
We feel that we are not as good in real@@ ity as we are in gam@@ es.
I don't mean just good as in succ@@ ess@@ ful@@ , al@@ though that's part of it.
We do achie@@ ve more in game world@@ s.
But I also mean good as in mo@@ tiv@@ ated to do something that mat@@ ters -- inspi@@ red to coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ate and to co@@ oper@@ ate.
And when we're in game worl@@ ds, I believe that many of us become the best ver@@ sion of our@@ selves -- the most lik@@ ely to help at a mom@@ ent@@ 's no@@ tic@@ e, the most lik@@ ely to st@@ ick with a problem as long at it ta@@ k@@ es, to get up after fail@@ ure and try again.
And in real life, when we face fail@@ ure, when we con@@ front ob@@ st@@ ac@@ l@@ es, we often don't feel that way.
We feel over@@ com@@ e, we feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ me@@ d, we feel an@@ x@@ i@@ ou@@ s, maybe de@@ pres@@ se@@ d, f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated or cy@@ n@@ ic@@ al.
We never have those feel@@ ings when we're pla@@ ying gam@@ es, they just don't ex@@ ist in gam@@ es.
So that's what I wanted to study when I was a gra@@ du@@ ate stu@@ den@@ t.
What about gam@@ es makes it im@@ possible to feel that we can't achie@@ ve every@@ thing@@ ?
How can we take those feel@@ ings from gam@@ es and ap@@ ply them to real@@ -@@ world work@@ ?
So I looked at gam@@ es like World of War@@ cra@@ ft, which is really the ide@@ al coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ative problem@@ -@@ sol@@ ving environ@@ ment.
And I started to no@@ tice a few things that make ep@@ ic win@@ s so possible in on@@ line world@@ s.
The first thing is wh@@ en@@ ever you show up in one of these on@@ line gam@@ es, es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally in World of War@@ cra@@ ft, there are lots and lots of different charac@@ ters who are will@@ ing to tr@@ ust you with a world@@ -@@ sa@@ ving mis@@ sion, right a@@ way.
But not just any mis@@ sion, it's a mis@@ sion that is perf@@ ec@@ tly mat@@ ched with your curr@@ ent level in the gam@@ e.
Righ@@ t? So you can do it.
They never give you a chall@@ enge you can't achie@@ ve.
But it is on the ver@@ ge of what you're cap@@ able of, so you have to try har@@ d.
But there's no un@@ em@@ plo@@ y@@ ment in World of War@@ cra@@ ft@@ ; no sitting aroun@@ d, wr@@ ing@@ ing your hand@@ s -- there's always something spec@@ if@@ ic and important to be don@@ e.
There are also t@@ ons of coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ator@@ s.
Every@@ where you go@@ , hundre@@ ds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achie@@ ve your ep@@ ic mis@@ sion.
That's not something we have in real life that eas@@ il@@ y, this sense that at our fing@@ er@@ ti@@ ps are t@@ ons of coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ator@@ s.
And there's this ep@@ ic stor@@ y, this in@@ spir@@ ing story of why we're there, and what we're do@@ ing, and we get all this positi@@ ve fe@@ ed@@ bac@@ k.
You guys have heard of level@@ ing up, +@@ 1 str@@ eng@@ th, +@@ 1 intelligen@@ ce.
We don't get that kind of con@@ st@@ ant fe@@ ed@@ back in real life.
When I get off this st@@ age, I'm not going to have +@@ 1 spe@@ ak@@ ing, and +@@ 1 cra@@ z@@ y ide@@ a, +@@ 20 cra@@ z@@ y ide@@ a.
I don't get that fe@@ ed@@ back in real life.
Now, the problem with coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ative on@@ line environ@@ ments like World of War@@ c@@ raft is that it's so sat@@ is@@ f@@ ying to be on the ver@@ ge of an ep@@ ic w@@ in all the time, we deci@@ de to spend all our time in these game world@@ s.
It's just better than real@@ ity.
So, so far@@ , collec@@ tiv@@ ely all the World of War@@ c@@ raft gam@@ ers have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years sol@@ ving the virtu@@ al problems of A@@ zer@@ o@@ th.
Now, that's not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily a bad thing.
It might sound like it's a bad thing.
But to put that in con@@ tex@@ t: 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago was when our ear@@ li@@ est pri@@ m@@ ate human anc@@ est@@ ors st@@ ood up.
That was the first up@@ right pri@@ mat@@ e.
So when we talk about how much time we're curr@@ ently inves@@ ting in pla@@ ying gam@@ es, the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de of human evol@@ u@@ tion, which is an extra@@ ordinary thing.
But it's also ap@@ t, because it turns out that by sp@@ end@@ ing all this time pla@@ ying gam@@ es, we're actually chang@@ ing what we are cap@@ able of as human bein@@ g@@ s.
We're evol@@ ving to be a more coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ative and hear@@ ty speci@@ es.
This is tru@@ e. I believe this.
So, consi@@ der this really interesting st@@ atist@@ ic@@ ; it was rec@@ ently publi@@ sh@@ ed by a resear@@ ch@@ er at Car@@ neg@@ ie M@@ ell@@ on Univers@@ it@@ y: The aver@@ age young person today in a country with a str@@ ong gam@@ er cul@@ ture will have spent 10@@ ,000 hours pla@@ ying on@@ line gam@@ es by the age of 2@@ 1.
Now 10@@ ,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reas@@ ons.
Fir@@ st of all, for children in the United Stat@@ es, 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 80 hours is the ex@@ act amount of time you will spend in school@@ , from fi@@ f@@ th gra@@ de to high school gra@@ du@@ ation, if you have perf@@ ect atten@@ d@@ anc@@ e.
So, we have an entire par@@ all@@ el tr@@ ack of educ@@ ation going on, where young people are lear@@ ning as much about what it takes to be a good gam@@ er as they're lear@@ ning about everything else in school@@ .
Some of you have probably read Mal@@ col@@ m G@@ l@@ ad@@ well@@ 's new book "@@ O@@ ut@@ li@@ er@@ s@@ ," so you would have heard of his the@@ ory of succ@@ ess, the "@@ 10@@ ,000 hour@@ s@@ " the@@ ory of succ@@ ess.
It's based on this great cogn@@ iti@@ v@@ e-@@ science research that says if we can ma@@ ster 10@@ ,000 hours of eff@@ ort@@ ful study at anything by the age of 2@@ 1@@ , we will be virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at it.
We will be as good at whatever we do as the great@@ est people in the world.
And so, now what we're looking at is an entire gener@@ ation of young people who are virtu@@ o@@ so g@@ am@@ er@@ s.
So, the big question is, "What exactly are gam@@ ers getting so good at@@ ?"
Because if we could figure that out, we would have a virtu@@ ally un@@ pre@@ c@@ ed@@ ented human res@@ ource on our hand@@ s.
This is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an h@@ our a day pla@@ ying on@@ line gam@@ es.
These are our virtu@@ o@@ so g@@ am@@ er@@ s, 500 million people who are extra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily good at some@@ thing.
And in the next dec@@ ad@@ e, we're going to have another billion gam@@ ers who are extra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily good at whatever that is.
If you don't know it al@@ read@@ y, this is com@@ ing.
The game industr@@ y is developing con@@ sol@@ es that are low@@ -@@ energy and that work with the wir@@ el@@ ess phone net@@ works instead of bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and Intern@@ et, so that gam@@ ers all over the world, partic@@ ular@@ ly in Indi@@ a, Chin@@ a, Bra@@ z@@ il@@ , can get on@@ lin@@ e.
They exp@@ ect one billion more gam@@ ers in the next dec@@ ad@@ e.
It will bring us up to 1@@ .@@ 5 billion g@@ am@@ er@@ s.
So I've started to think about what these gam@@ es are making us virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at.
Here are the four things I came up with@@ . The first is ur@@ gen@@ t op@@ tim@@ is@@ m.
OK, think of this as extre@@ me self-@@ mo@@ tiv@@ ation.
U@@ r@@ gen@@ t op@@ tim@@ is@@ m is the des@@ ire to act im@@ medi@@ ately to t@@ ack@@ le an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le, com@@ bin@@ ed with the belie@@ f that we have a reas@@ on@@ able hope of succ@@ ess.
G@@ am@@ ers always believe that an ep@@ ic w@@ in is possi@@ bl@@ e, and that it's always wor@@ th tr@@ y@@ ing, and trying now.
G@@ am@@ ers don't s@@ it aroun@@ d.
G@@ am@@ ers are virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at we@@ a@@ ving a ti@@ ght social f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c@@ .
There's a lot of interesting research that shows we like people better after we play a game with them, even if they've be@@ at@@ en us b@@ ad@@ ly.
And the reason is, it takes a lot of tr@@ ust to play a game with some@@ one.
We tr@@ ust that they will spend their time with us, that they will play by the same rul@@ es, val@@ ue the same go@@ al, sta@@ y with the game until it's over@@ .
And so, pla@@ ying a game together actually buil@@ ds up b@@ on@@ ds and tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ation.
And we actually build stron@@ ger social relation@@ shi@@ ps as a resul@@ t.
B@@ lis@@ s@@ ful produc@@ tiv@@ ity. I love it.
You know, there's a reason why the aver@@ age World of War@@ c@@ raft gam@@ er pla@@ ys for 2@@ 2 hours a we@@ ek -- kind of a hal@@ f@@ -@@ time job@@ .
It's because we know, when we're pla@@ ying a gam@@ e, that we're actually happ@@ ier working hard than we are rel@@ ax@@ ing, or h@@ ang@@ ing out.
We know that we are op@@ tim@@ ized as human bein@@ g@@ s, to do hard and mean@@ ing@@ ful work.
And gam@@ ers are will@@ ing to work hard all the time, if they're given the right work.
Fin@@ all@@ y: ep@@ ic mean@@ ing.
G@@ am@@ ers love to be att@@ ach@@ ed to a@@ we@@ -@@ in@@ spir@@ ing mis@@ si@@ ons to human plan@@ et@@ ar@@ y-@@ sc@@ ale stor@@ i@@ es.
So, just one bit of tri@@ vi@@ a that hel@@ ps put that into per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ e: So, you all know W@@ ik@@ i@@ pedi@@ a, big@@ gest wi@@ k@@ i in the world.
S@@ econ@@ d big@@ gest wi@@ k@@ i in the world, with ne@@ ar@@ ly 8@@ 0@@ ,000 ar@@ tic@@ l@@ es, is the World of War@@ c@@ raft wi@@ ki@@ .
F@@ i@@ ve million people use it every mon@@ th.
They have comp@@ il@@ ed more information about World of War@@ c@@ raft on the Internet than any other top@@ ic cover@@ ed on any other wi@@ k@@ i in the world.
They are building an ep@@ ic story.
They are building an ep@@ ic knowle@@ dge res@@ ource about the World of War@@ cra@@ ft.
Okay, so these are four super@@ power@@ s that ad@@ d up to one thing@@ : G@@ am@@ ers are super@@ -@@ em@@ power@@ ed ho@@ pe@@ ful individu@@ als.
These are people who believe that they are individu@@ ally cap@@ able of chang@@ ing the world.
And the only problem is, they believe that they are cap@@ able of chang@@ ing virtu@@ al worl@@ ds and not the real world.
That's the problem that I'm trying to sol@@ ve.
There's an econom@@ ist nam@@ ed E@@ d@@ ward C@@ a@@ stron@@ o@@ v@@ a.
H@@ is work is bri@@ lli@@ an@@ t.
He looks at why people are inves@@ ting so much time and energy and money in on@@ line world@@ s.
And he says, "@@ We're wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ing what amoun@@ ts to no less than a mas@@ s ex@@ o@@ du@@ s to virtu@@ al worl@@ ds and on@@ line game environ@@ ment@@ s."
And he's an econom@@ ist, so he's r@@ ation@@ al.
And he says -- Not like me, I'm a game design@@ er@@ ; I'm ex@@ u@@ ber@@ an@@ t.
But he says that this makes perf@@ ect sen@@ se, because gam@@ ers can achie@@ ve more in on@@ line worl@@ ds than they can in real life.
They can have stron@@ ger social relation@@ shi@@ ps in gam@@ es than they can have in real li@@ fe@@ ; they get better fe@@ ed@@ back and feel more re@@ war@@ ded in gam@@ es than they do in real life.
So he says, for now it makes perf@@ ect sense for gam@@ ers to spend more time in virtu@@ al worl@@ ds than the real world.
Now, I also agre@@ e that that is r@@ ation@@ al, for now.
But it is no@@ t, by any mean@@ s, an op@@ tim@@ al s@@ itu@@ ation.
We have to start making the real world work more like a gam@@ e.
I take my in@@ spir@@ ation from something that happened 2@@ ,@@ 500 years ago.
These are an@@ ci@@ ent dic@@ e, made out of sh@@ e@@ ep@@ 's k@@ nu@@ ck@@ l@@ es.
Be@@ for@@ e we had a@@ wes@@ ome game contro@@ ll@@ ers, we had sh@@ e@@ ep@@ 's k@@ nu@@ ck@@ l@@ es.
And these repres@@ ent the first game equ@@ i@@ p@@ ment design@@ ed by human bein@@ g@@ s, and if you're famili@@ ar with the work of the an@@ ci@@ ent Gre@@ ek h@@ ist@@ ori@@ an Her@@ o@@ do@@ t@@ us, you might know this histor@@ y, which is the history of who inv@@ ented gam@@ es and wh@@ y.
Her@@ o@@ do@@ tu@@ s says that gam@@ es, partic@@ ular@@ ly di@@ ce gam@@ es, were inv@@ ented in the k@@ ing@@ dom of L@@ y@@ di@@ a, during a time of fam@@ ine.
A@@ pp@@ ar@@ ent@@ ly, there was such a sever@@ e fam@@ ine that the king of L@@ y@@ di@@ a decided they had to do something cra@@ z@@ y.
People were su@@ ffer@@ ing. People were f@@ igh@@ t@@ ing.
It was an extre@@ me s@@ itu@@ ation, they needed an extre@@ me sol@@ u@@ tion.
So, acc@@ ord@@ ing to Her@@ o@@ do@@ t@@ us, they inv@@ ented di@@ ce gam@@ es, and they set up a k@@ ing@@ dom@@ -@@ wi@@ de po@@ lic@@ y: On one day, everybody would e@@ at, and on the next day, everybody would play gam@@ es.
And they would be so im@@ mer@@ sed in pla@@ ying the di@@ ce gam@@ es, because gam@@ es are so eng@@ ag@@ ing, and im@@ mer@@ se us in such sat@@ is@@ f@@ y@@ ing, b@@ lis@@ s@@ ful produc@@ tiv@@ ity, they would ign@@ ore the fact that they had no food to e@@ at.
And then on the next day, they would play gam@@ es@@ ; and on the next day, they would e@@ at.
And acc@@ ord@@ ing to Her@@ o@@ do@@ t@@ us, they pas@@ sed 18 years this way, survi@@ ving through a fam@@ ine, by e@@ ating on one day, and pla@@ ying gam@@ es on the nex@@ t.
Now, this is ex@@ ac@@ tl@@ y, I think, how we're using gam@@ es today.
We're using gam@@ es to es@@ cap@@ e real@@ -@@ world su@@ ffer@@ ing -- we're using gam@@ es to get away from everything that's bro@@ ken in the real environ@@ ment, everything that's not sat@@ is@@ f@@ ying about real life, and we're getting what we need from gam@@ es.
But it doesn't have to end there.
This is really exc@@ it@@ ing.
A@@ cc@@ ord@@ ing to Her@@ o@@ do@@ t@@ us, after 18 years the fam@@ ine wasn't getting bet@@ ter, so the king decided they would play one fin@@ al di@@ ce gam@@ e.
They di@@ vi@@ ded the entire k@@ ing@@ dom in hal@@ f.
They play@@ ed one di@@ ce gam@@ e, and the w@@ inn@@ ers of that game got to go on an ep@@ ic adv@@ ent@@ ure.
They would leave L@@ y@@ di@@ a, and they would go out in se@@ ar@@ ch of a new place to li@@ ve, lea@@ ving behind just enough people to survi@@ ve on the resourc@@ es that were av@@ ail@@ able, and ho@@ pe@@ fully to take their civi@@ liz@@ ation some@@ where else where they could th@@ ri@@ ve.
Now, this so@@ unds cra@@ z@@ y, right?
But rec@@ ent@@ ly, DNA evi@@ dence has sho@@ wn that the E@@ tr@@ us@@ can@@ s, who then led to the R@@ om@@ an E@@ m@@ pi@@ re, actually share the same DNA as the an@@ ci@@ ent L@@ y@@ di@@ an@@ s.
And so, rec@@ ent@@ ly, scienti@@ sts have sug@@ ges@@ ted that Her@@ o@@ do@@ t@@ us@@ ' cra@@ z@@ y story is actually tru@@ e.
And ge@@ olog@@ ists have found evi@@ dence of a global cool@@ ing that la@@ st@@ ed for ne@@ ar@@ ly 20 years, that could have expl@@ ain@@ ed the fam@@ ine.
So this cra@@ z@@ y story might be tru@@ e.
They might have actually sa@@ ved their cul@@ ture by pla@@ ying gam@@ es, es@@ cap@@ ing to gam@@ es for 18 years, and then been so inspi@@ re@@ d, and knew so much about how to come together with gam@@ es, that they actually sa@@ ved the entire civi@@ liz@@ ation that way.
Okay, we can do that.
We've been pla@@ ying War@@ c@@ raft since 199@@ 4@@ .
That was the first real@@ -@@ time str@@ at@@ eg@@ y game from the World of War@@ c@@ raft seri@@ es.
That was 1@@ 6 years ago.
They play@@ ed di@@ ce gam@@ es for 18 years, we've been pla@@ ying War@@ c@@ raft for 1@@ 6 years.
I say we are ready for our own ep@@ ic gam@@ e.
Now, they had half the civi@@ liz@@ ation go off in se@@ ar@@ ch of a new world, so that's where I get my 2@@ 1 billion hours a we@@ ek of gam@@ e-@@ play fro@@ m.
Let's get half of us to agre@@ e to spend an h@@ our a day pla@@ ying gam@@ es, until we sol@@ ve real@@ -@@ world problem@@ s.
Now, I know you're as@@ k@@ ing, "@@ How are we going to sol@@ ve real@@ -@@ world problems in gam@@ es@@ ?"
Well, that's what I've de@@ vo@@ ted my work to over the pas@@ t few years, at the Institu@@ te for the F@@ ut@@ ure.
We have this b@@ ann@@ er in our off@@ ic@@ es in P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to, and it ex@@ pres@@ ses our view of how we should try to rel@@ ate to the fut@@ ure.
We do not want to try to predic@@ t the fut@@ ure.
What we want to do is make the fut@@ ure.
We want to imagine the bes@@ t@@ -@@ case sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o out@@ com@@ e, and then we want to em@@ power people to make that out@@ come a real@@ ity.
We want to imagine ep@@ ic win@@ s, and then give people the means to achie@@ ve the ep@@ ic win@@ .
I'm just going to very bri@@ ef@@ ly show you three gam@@ es that I've made that are an at@@ tem@@ p@@ t to give people the means to create ep@@ ic win@@ s in their own fut@@ ur@@ es.
This is World Wi@@ th@@ out O@@ il@@ .
We made this game in 200@@ 7@@ .
This is an on@@ line game in which you try to survi@@ ve an oil sh@@ ort@@ age.
The oil sh@@ ort@@ age is f@@ ic@@ tion@@ al, but we put enough on@@ line cont@@ ent out there for you to believe that it's re@@ al, and to live your real life as if we've run out of o@@ il@@ . So when you come to the gam@@ e, you s@@ ign up, tell us where you li@@ ve, and then we give you real@@ -@@ time news vide@@ o@@ s, data fe@@ eds that show you exactly how much oil co@@ st@@ s, what's not av@@ ail@@ able, how food sup@@ ply is being aff@@ ec@@ ted,
how tran@@ sp@@ ort@@ ation is being aff@@ ec@@ ted, if school@@ s are clo@@ se@@ d, if there's ri@@ o@@ t@@ ing, and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were tru@@ e. And then we ask you to blo@@ g about it, to po@@ st vide@@ o@@ s, to po@@ st pho@@ to@@ s.
We p@@ ilo@@ ted this game with 1,@@ 7@@ 00 play@@ ers in 200@@ 7@@ , and we've trac@@ ked them for the three years sin@@ ce.
And I can tell you that this is a transform@@ ative experi@@ ence.
No@@ body wan@@ ts to change how they li@@ ve, just because it's good for the world, or because we're sup@@ posed to.
But if you im@@ mer@@ se them in an ep@@ ic adv@@ ent@@ ure and tell them, "@@ We've run out of o@@ il@@ .
This is an amazing story and adv@@ ent@@ ure for you to go on.
Ch@@ all@@ enge your@@ self to see how you would survi@@ ve@@ ," most of our play@@ ers have k@@ ept up the hab@@ its that they learned in this gam@@ e.
So for the next world@@ -@@ sa@@ ving gam@@ e, we decided to a@@ im high@@ er -- big@@ ger problem than just pe@@ ak o@@ il@@ .
We did a game called Su@@ per@@ struc@@ t at the Institu@@ te for the F@@ ut@@ ure.
And the pre@@ mis@@ e was, a super@@ computer has cal@@ cul@@ ated that hum@@ ans have only 2@@ 3 years left on the plan@@ et.
This super@@ computer was called the G@@ lob@@ al Ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion A@@ war@@ en@@ ess Sy@@ st@@ em@@ , of cour@@ se.
We asked people to come on@@ line -- almost like a J@@ err@@ y B@@ ru@@ ck@@ hei@@ mer mo@@ vi@@ e.
You know J@@ err@@ y B@@ ru@@ ck@@ hei@@ mer mo@@ vi@@ es, you form a dre@@ am te@@ am -- you've got the a@@ stron@@ au@@ t, the scienti@@ st, the ex@@ -@@ con@@ vic@@ t, and they all have something to do to sa@@ ve the world.
But in our gam@@ e, instead of just having five people on the dre@@ am te@@ am, we said, "@@ Every@@ bo@@ dy@@ 's on the dre@@ am te@@ am, and it's your job to inv@@ ent the future of energ@@ y, the future of foo@@ d, the future of heal@@ th, the future of sec@@ ur@@ ity and the future of the social sa@@ f@@ et@@ y net@@ ."
We had 8@@ ,000 people play that game for eight week@@ s.
They came up with 500 ins@@ an@@ ely cre@@ ative sol@@ u@@ tions that you can go on@@ lin@@ e, Google "@@ Su@@ per@@ struc@@ t@@ ," and se@@ e.
So, fin@@ ally, the last gam@@ e, we're la@@ un@@ ching it Mar@@ ch 3@@ r@@ d. This is a game done with the World B@@ ank In@@ st@@ it@@ ut@@ e.
If you compl@@ ete the gam@@ e, you will be cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ed by the World B@@ ank Institu@@ te as a So@@ cial In@@ nov@@ at@@ or, clas@@ s of 20@@ 10@@ .
Wor@@ king with univers@@ ities all over sub@@ -S@@ ah@@ ar@@ an Afric@@ a, and we are inv@@ iting them to learn social innov@@ ation sk@@ ill@@ s.
We've got a gra@@ phi@@ c no@@ vel@@ , we've got level@@ ing up in sk@@ ill@@ s like lo@@ cal ins@@ igh@@ t, knowle@@ dge net@@ work@@ ing, su@@ stain@@ abili@@ ty, vis@@ ion and resourc@@ ef@@ ul@@ n@@ ess.
I would like to inv@@ ite all of you to pleas@@ e share this game with young people, any@@ where in the world, partic@@ ular@@ ly in developing ar@@ eas@@ , who might ben@@ ef@@ it from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enter@@ pris@@ es to sa@@ ve the world.
So, I'm going to w@@ ra@@ p up now.
I want to ask a ques@@ tion.
What do you think happens nex@@ t?
We've got all these amazing g@@ am@@ er@@ s, we've got these gam@@ es that are kind of p@@ ilo@@ ts of what we might do, but n@@ one of them have sa@@ ved the real world y@@ et.
Wel@@ l I hope you will agre@@ e with me that gam@@ ers are a human res@@ ource that we can use to do real@@ -@@ world work, that gam@@ es are a powerful plat@@ form for chang@@ e.
We have all these amazing super@@ power@@ s: b@@ lis@@ s@@ ful produc@@ tiv@@ ity, the ability to we@@ a@@ ve a ti@@ ght social f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c@@ , this feel@@ ing of ur@@ gen@@ t op@@ tim@@ is@@ m and the des@@ ire for ep@@ ic mean@@ ing.
I really hope that we can come together to play gam@@ es that mat@@ ter, to survi@@ ve on this planet for another centur@@ y.
That's my hop@@ e, that you will jo@@ in me in making and pla@@ ying gam@@ es like this.
When I look for@@ ward to the next dec@@ ad@@ e, I know two things for su@@ re@@ : that we can make any future we can imag@@ ine, and we can play any gam@@ es we wan@@ t, so I sa@@ y: L@@ et the world@@ -@@ chang@@ ing gam@@ es beg@@ in.
Thank you.
For some time I have been interested in the plac@@ eb@@ o effec@@ t, which might se@@ em like an o@@ d@@ d thing for a mag@@ ici@@ an to be interested in, un@@ less you think of it in the terms that I do, which is, "@@ Som@@ e@@ thing fa@@ ke is belie@@ ved in enough by somebody that it be@@ comes something real@@ ."
In other wor@@ ds, su@@ gar p@@ ill@@ s have a meas@@ ur@@ able eff@@ ect in certain kinds of stu@@ dies@@ , the plac@@ eb@@ o effec@@ t, just because the person thin@@ ks that what's happening to them is a ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ eu@@ tical or some sort of a -- for pa@@ in man@@ ag@@ em@@ ent, for example, if they believe it enough there is a meas@@ ur@@ able eff@@ ect in the body called the plac@@ eb@@ o effec@@ t.
Som@@ e@@ thing fa@@ ke be@@ comes something real because of some@@ on@@ e's perc@@ ep@@ tion of it.
In order for us to understand each other@@ , I want to start by sho@@ wing you a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ar@@ y, very simple mag@@ ic tri@@ ck.
And I'm going to show you how it work@@ s. This is a tri@@ ck that's been in every childr@@ en@@ 's mag@@ ic book since at least the 19@@ 50@@ s.
I learned it myself from C@@ u@@ b S@@ c@@ out Mag@@ ic in the 197@@ 0@@ s.
I'll do it for you, and then I'll ex@@ pla@@ in it.
And then I'll ex@@ pla@@ in why I expl@@ ain@@ ed it.
So, here's what happen@@ s.
The kn@@ if@@ e, which you can ex@@ am@@ ine@@ ; my h@@ and, which you could ex@@ am@@ ine.
I'm just going to hold the kn@@ if@@ e in my f@@ ist like this.
I'll get my s@@ le@@ e@@ ve bac@@ k.
And to make sure nothing goes up or down my s@@ le@@ e@@ ve I'm just going to squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze my wr@@ ist right here.
That way you can see that at no time can anything tra@@ vel@@ , as long as I'm squ@@ e@@ e@@ z@@ ing there nothing can go up or down my s@@ le@@ ev@@ e.
And the objec@@ t of this is quite simpl@@ e.
I'm going to open my h@@ and, and ho@@ pe@@ ful@@ ly, if all is well, my p@@ ure anim@@ al mag@@ net@@ is@@ m will hold the kn@@ if@@ e.
In fact it's hel@@ d so ti@@ gh@@ tly in place that I can sha@@ ke it, and the kn@@ if@@ e does not come off@@ .
No@@ thing goes up or down my s@@ le@@ ev@@ e, no tri@@ ck@@ er@@ y. And you can ex@@ am@@ ine every@@ thing.
Ta@@ -@@ da@@ !
So, this is a tri@@ ck that I often te@@ ach to young children that are interested in mag@@ ic, because you can learn a great deal about dec@@ ep@@ tion by stud@@ ying this very -- even though it's a very simple tri@@ ck me@@ tho@@ d@@ olog@@ ic@@ ally.
Pro@@ bab@@ ly many of you in the room know this tri@@ ck.
What happens is this.
I hold the kn@@ if@@ e in my h@@ and.
I say I'm going to gra@@ b hold of my wr@@ ist to make sure nothing goes up or down my s@@ le@@ ev@@ e, that is a li@@ e.
The reason I'm hol@@ ding on@@ to my wr@@ ist is because that's actually the sec@@ re@@ t of the ill@@ usi@@ on.
In a moment when my hand mo@@ ves from fac@@ ing you to being away from you, this fing@@ er right here, my in@@ de@@ x fing@@ er is just going to shi@@ ft from where it is, to a pos@@ ition poin@@ ting out like this.
N@@ ice one.
Som@@ e@@ one who didn't have a ch@@ ild@@ ho@@ od is out there.
So, it goes like this, from here, right.
And as I move around my fing@@ er shi@@ ft@@ s.
And we could talk about why this is dec@@ ep@@ tiv@@ e, why you don't no@@ tice there are only three fing@@ ers down here, because the min@@ d, and the way it proc@@ ess@@ es inform@@ ation, it doesn't coun@@ t, one, tw@@ o, thre@@ e. It grou@@ ps them.
But that's not really what this is ab@@ out. Righ@@ t? And then I open my hand up.
Ob@@ vi@@ ously it's cl@@ ing@@ ing there, not by anim@@ al mag@@ net@@ is@@ m, but by ch@@ ic@@ an@@ er@@ y, my in@@ de@@ x fing@@ er being there.
And then when I close my fing@@ er, same thing, as I move back, this mo@@ tion kind of cover@@ s the moving back of my fing@@ er.
I take this hand a@@ way. You give the kn@@ if@@ e out.
There is a tri@@ ck you can do for your fri@@ ends and neigh@@ bor@@ s. Th@@ ank@@ s.
Now, what does that have to do with the plac@@ eb@@ o effec@@ t?
I read a study a year or so ago that really ble@@ w my mind wi@@ de op@@ en.
I'm not a doc@@ tor or a resear@@ ch@@ er, so this, to me, was an ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing thing.
It turns out that if you ad@@ minist@@ er a plac@@ eb@@ o in the form of a wh@@ ite p@@ ill@@ , that's like as@@ p@@ ir@@ in shap@@ ed -- it's just a ro@@ und wh@@ ite p@@ ill -- it has some certain meas@@ ur@@ able effec@@ t.
But if you change the form that you give the plac@@ eb@@ o in, like you make a sm@@ aller p@@ ill@@ , and col@@ or it bl@@ u@@ e, and st@@ am@@ p a let@@ ter into it, it is actually meas@@ ur@@ ab@@ ly more effec@@ tiv@@ e.
E@@ ven though n@@ ei@@ ther one of these things has any ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ eu@@ tical -- they're su@@ gar p@@ ill@@ s.
But a wh@@ ite p@@ ill is not as good as a bl@@ ue p@@ ill@@ .
What@@ ? That really f@@ li@@ pped me out.
T@@ ur@@ ns out though@@ , that that's not even where it st@@ op@@ s.
If you have cap@@ s@@ ul@@ es, they're more effec@@ tive than t@@ abl@@ ets in any form@@ .
A col@@ or@@ ed cap@@ s@@ ul@@ e, that's y@@ el@@ low on one end and red on the other is better than a wh@@ ite cap@@ s@@ ul@@ e.
Do@@ sage has something to do with this.
One p@@ ill t@@ wi@@ ce a day is not as good at three p@@ ill@@ s -- I don't remember the st@@ atist@@ ic now. S@@ or@@ r@@ y.
But the point is ...
... these do@@ sag@@ es have something to do with it.
And the form has something to do with it.
And if you want the ul@@ tim@@ ate in plac@@ eb@@ o, you've go to the need@@ le.
Righ@@ t? A sy@@ r@@ ing@@ e with some in@@ ert -- a couple C@@ C@@ s of some in@@ ert some@@ thing, and you in@@ jec@@ t this into a pati@@ ent ...
Wel@@ l this is such a powerful im@@ age in their min@@ d, it's so much stron@@ ger than the wh@@ ite p@@ ill@@ .
It's a really, this gra@@ ph@@ , well I'll show it to you some other time when we have sli@@ d@@ es.
The point is the wh@@ ite p@@ ill is not as good as the bl@@ ue p@@ ill is not as good as the cap@@ su@@ le is not as good as the need@@ le.
And n@@ one of it has any real ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ eu@@ tical qu@@ al@@ ity, it's only your belie@@ f that makes it real in your body and makes a stron@@ ger effec@@ t.
I wanted to see if I could take that idea and ap@@ ply it to a mag@@ ic tri@@ ck.
And take something that is obvi@@ ously a fa@@ ke tri@@ ck and make it se@@ em re@@ al.
And we know from that study that when you want real@@ ity, you go to the need@@ le.
This is a se@@ ven@@ -@@ in@@ ch hat@@ p@@ in. It's very, very shar@@ p, and I'm going to just ster@@ ili@@ ze it a tin@@ y b@@ it.
This is really my fl@@ es@@ h. This is not D@@ am@@ i@@ an@@ 's speci@@ al@@ -@@ gro@@ wn fl@@ es@@ h.
That's my sk@@ in right there. This is not a H@@ oll@@ y@@ w@@ ood speci@@ al effec@@ t.
I'm going to p@@ ier@@ ce my sk@@ in and run this need@@ le through to the other si@@ de.
If you're qu@@ eas@@ y -- if you f@@ ain@@ t eas@@ ily -- I was doing this for some fri@@ ends in the ho@@ tel room last nigh@@ t, and some people that I didn't know, and one woman almost pas@@ sed out.
So, I sug@@ gest if you get qu@@ eas@@ y eas@@ y that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact, you know what@@ , I'll do the first bad part behind it.
You@@ 'll get to see, you can look away too if you@@ 'd like to.
So, here is what happen@@ s, right here, the beginning of my fl@@ es@@ h at the lo@@ wer part of my ar@@ m I just make a little p@@ ier@@ ce.
I'm sor@@ r@@ y, man@@ . A@@ m I fre@@ a@@ king you ou@@ t?
OK, and then just through my sk@@ in a tin@@ y b@@ it, and then out the other side like this.
Now, essenti@@ ally we're in the same pos@@ ition we were in with the kn@@ if@@ e tri@@ ck.
S@@ ort of@@ .
But you can't coun@@ t my fing@@ ers right now can you@@ ?
So, let me show them to you. That's one, two thre@@ e, four@@ , fi@@ ve.
Y@@ es, well@@ ...
I know what people think when they see this.
They go@@ , "Well, he's certain@@ ly not d@@ um@@ b enough to sta@@ b him@@ self through the sk@@ in to enter@@ tain us for a few minut@@ es.
So, let me give you a little pe@@ ek@@ .
Ho@@ w@@ 's that look out ther@@ e? P@@ re@@ tt@@ y goo@@ d.
Ye@@ ah, I know. And the people in the back go@@ , "@@ OK, I didn't really see that@@ ."
People in the sat@@ elli@@ te room are starting to move in now.
L@@ et me give you good close look at this.
That really is my sk@@ in. That is not a H@@ oll@@ y@@ w@@ ood speci@@ al effec@@ t.
That's my fl@@ es@@ h, and I can tw@@ ist that aroun@@ d.
I'm sor@@ r@@ y. If you're getting qu@@ eas@@ y, look a@@ way, don't look at the thing.
People in the back or people on video years from now wat@@ ching this will go@@ , "@@ Wel@@ l ye@@ ah, that looks kind of ne@@ at in some sort of eff@@ ect there, but if it were real he would be -- see there's a h@@ ole there and a h@@ ole there, if it were real he would be ble@@ ed@@ ing.
Wel@@ l let me work up some bloo@@ d for you.
Y@@ es, there it is.
Nor@@ m@@ ally now, I would take the need@@ le out.
I would cle@@ an off my ar@@ m, and I would show you that there are no wo@@ und@@ s.
But I think in this con@@ tex@@ t and with the idea of taking something fa@@ ke and making it into something re@@ al, I'm just going to leave it there, and walk off the st@@ age.
I will be seeing you sever@@ al times over the next few da@@ ys.
I hope you're looking for@@ ward to that. Thank you very much.
So, I've known a lot of fish in my life.
I've lo@@ ved only tw@@ o.
That first one, it was more like a passi@@ on@@ ate aff@@ air@@ .
It was a beautiful f@@ ish@@ : fl@@ a@@ vor@@ ful@@ , tex@@ tu@@ re@@ d, me@@ at@@ y, a bes@@ ts@@ ell@@ er on the men@@ u@@ .
What a f@@ ish@@ .
E@@ ven bet@@ ter, it was far@@ m@@ -@@ ra@@ is@@ ed to the sup@@ posed high@@ est stand@@ ar@@ ds of su@@ stain@@ abili@@ ty.
So you could feel good about s@@ ell@@ ing it.
I was in a relation@@ ship with this beau@@ ty for sever@@ al month@@ s.
One day, the head of the company called and asked if I'd spe@@ ak at an ev@@ ent about the far@@ m@@ 's su@@ stain@@ abili@@ ty.
"@@ Ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ el@@ y@@ ," I sai@@ d.
Here was a company trying to sol@@ ve what's become this un@@ imagin@@ able problem for us ch@@ ef@@ s: How do we keep fish on our men@@ us@@ ?
For the pas@@ t 50 years, we've been f@@ ish@@ ing the se@@ as like we clear@@ -@@ cut for@@ est@@ s.
It's hard to over@@ state the des@@ tru@@ c@@ tion.
N@@ in@@ et@@ y percent of large f@@ is@@ h, the ones we love -- the tun@@ as, the hal@@ i@@ but@@ s, the s@@ al@@ mon@@ s, s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish -- they've coll@@ ap@@ se@@ d.
There's almost nothing le@@ ft.
So, for better or for wor@@ se, a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture, fish far@@ m@@ ing, is going to be a part of our fut@@ ure.
A lot of ar@@ gum@@ ents against it@@ : F@@ ish far@@ ms poll@@ ute -- most of them do any@@ way -- and they're in@@ eff@@ ici@@ ent. Ta@@ ke tun@@ a, a maj@@ or dra@@ w@@ bac@@ k.
It's got a fe@@ ed con@@ ver@@ sion r@@ ati@@ o of 15 to one.
That means it takes fi@@ f@@ te@@ en po@@ unds of wi@@ ld fish to get you one po@@ und of far@@ m tun@@ a.
Not very su@@ stain@@ able.
It doesn't ta@@ ste very good ei@@ ther.
So here, fin@@ ally, was a company trying to do it right.
I wanted to supp@@ ort them.
The day before the ev@@ ent, I called the head of P@@ .@@ R@@ . for the compan@@ y.
Let's call him D@@ on.
"@@ D@@ on@@ ," I said, "@@ just to get the fac@@ ts stra@@ igh@@ t, you guys are fam@@ ous for far@@ m@@ ing so far out to se@@ a, you don't poll@@ ut@@ e."
"@@ That's righ@@ t@@ ," he sai@@ d. "@@ We're so far out, the wa@@ ste from our fish gets di@@ stri@@ but@@ ed, not con@@ cent@@ rat@@ ed@@ ."
And then he ad@@ de@@ d, "@@ We're basically a world un@@ to our@@ sel@@ ves.
That fe@@ ed con@@ ver@@ sion r@@ ati@@ o@@ ? 2@@ .@@ 5 to on@@ e@@ ," he sai@@ d.
"@@ B@@ est in the busin@@ ess@@ ."
2@@ .@@ 5 to one, gre@@ at.
"@@ 2@@ .@@ 5 what@@ ? What are you fe@@ ed@@ ing@@ ?"
"@@ Su@@ stain@@ able prot@@ ein@@ s@@ ," he sai@@ d.
"@@ Gre@@ at@@ ," I sai@@ d. Go@@ t off the ph@@ one.
And that nigh@@ t, I was l@@ ying in be@@ d, and I though@@ t: What the hel@@ l is a su@@ stain@@ able prot@@ ein@@ ?
So the next day, just before the ev@@ ent, I called D@@ on.
I said, "@@ D@@ on, what are some exampl@@ es of su@@ stain@@ able prot@@ ein@@ s@@ ?"
He said he didn't know. He would ask aroun@@ d.
Well, I got on the phone with a few people in the comp@@ any@@ ; no one could give me a stra@@ ight answer until fin@@ ally, I got on the phone with the head biolog@@ ist.
Let's call him D@@ on to@@ o.
"@@ D@@ on@@ ," I said, "@@ what are some exampl@@ es of su@@ stain@@ able prot@@ ein@@ s@@ ?"
Well, he men@@ tion@@ ed some al@@ ga@@ es and some fish me@@ als, and then he said ch@@ ic@@ ken p@@ ell@@ et@@ s.
I said, "@@ Ch@@ ic@@ ken p@@ ell@@ et@@ s@@ ?"
He said, "@@ Ye@@ ah, fe@@ a@@ ther@@ s, sk@@ in, b@@ one me@@ al, sc@@ ra@@ p@@ s, dri@@ ed and proc@@ ess@@ ed into fe@@ ed@@ ."
I said, "What perc@@ ent@@ age of your fe@@ ed is ch@@ ick@@ en@@ ?"
Th@@ ink@@ ing, you know, two perc@@ ent.
"Well, it's about 30 perc@@ ent@@ ," he sai@@ d.
I said, "@@ D@@ on, what's su@@ stain@@ able about fe@@ ed@@ ing ch@@ ic@@ ken to f@@ ish@@ ?"
There was a long p@@ ause on the lin@@ e, and he said, "@@ There's just too much ch@@ ic@@ ken in the world@@ ."
I f@@ ell out of love with this f@@ ish@@ .
N@@ o, not because I'm some self-@@ righ@@ te@@ ou@@ s, goo@@ dy@@ -@@ two sho@@ es foo@@ di@@ e.
I actually am.
N@@ o, I actually f@@ ell out of love with this fish bec@@ ause, I s@@ we@@ ar to Go@@ d, after that con@@ vers@@ ation, the fish tast@@ ed like ch@@ ick@@ en.
This second f@@ is@@ h, it's a different kind of love story.
It's the ro@@ man@@ tic kin@@ d, the kind where the more you get to know your f@@ is@@ h, you love the f@@ ish@@ .
I first ate it at a res@@ tau@@ r@@ ant in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ pa@@ in.
A jour@@ n@@ al@@ ist fri@@ end had been talking about this fish for a long time.
She kind of set us up.
It came to the t@@ able a b@@ right, almost sh@@ im@@ mer@@ ing, wh@@ ite col@@ or.
The che@@ f had over@@ co@@ o@@ ked it.
Li@@ ke t@@ wi@@ ce over@@ .
A@@ ma@@ z@@ ing@@ ly, it was still del@@ ici@@ ous.
Wh@@ o can make a fish ta@@ ste good after it's been over@@ co@@ ok@@ ed@@ ?
I can@@ '@@ t, but this guy can@@ .
Let's call him M@@ ig@@ u@@ el -- actually his name is M@@ ig@@ u@@ el.
And no@@ , he didn't co@@ ok the f@@ is@@ h, and he's not a ch@@ ef@@ , at least in the way that you and I understand it.
He's a biolog@@ ist at V@@ et@@ a L@@ a P@@ al@@ ma@@ .
It's a fish far@@ m in the s@@ ou@@ th@@ wes@@ tern cor@@ ner of S@@ pa@@ in.
It's at the ti@@ p of the Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qu@@ i@@ vi@@ r ri@@ ver@@ .
Un@@ ti@@ l the 198@@ 0@@ s, the far@@ m was in the hand@@ s of the Ar@@ gent@@ in@@ i@@ an@@ s.
They ra@@ is@@ ed be@@ e@@ f c@@ att@@ le on what was essenti@@ ally w@@ et@@ land@@ s.
They did it by dra@@ in@@ ing the lan@@ d.
They built this in@@ tri@@ c@@ ate ser@@ ies of can@@ als, and they p@@ us@@ h@@ ed water off the land and out into the ri@@ ver@@ .
Well, they couldn't make it work, not econom@@ ic@@ ally.
And ec@@ olog@@ ic@@ ally, it was a dis@@ ast@@ er.
It kill@@ ed like 9@@ 0 percent of the bir@@ ds, wh@@ ich, for this plac@@ e, is a lot of bir@@ ds.
And so in 198@@ 2@@ , a Sp@@ an@@ ish company with an environ@@ mental con@@ science p@@ urch@@ as@@ ed the lan@@ d.
What did they do@@ ?
They re@@ vers@@ ed the f@@ low of water.
They liter@@ ally f@@ li@@ pped the s@@ wit@@ ch.
In@@ stead of p@@ us@@ h@@ ing water out, they used the ch@@ ann@@ el@@ s to pul@@ l water back in.
They f@@ loo@@ ded the can@@ als.
They created a 2@@ 7@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ -@@ ac@@ re fish far@@ m -- bas@@ s, mul@@ l@@ et, sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p, e@@ el -- and in the proc@@ ess, M@@ ig@@ u@@ el and this company completely re@@ vers@@ ed the ec@@ olog@@ ical des@@ tru@@ c@@ tion.
The far@@ m@@ 's incredi@@ ble.
I mean, you've never seen anything like this.
You st@@ are out at a hor@@ iz@@ on that is a million miles a@@ way, and all you see are f@@ loo@@ ded can@@ als and this th@@ ic@@ k, r@@ ich mar@@ sh@@ lan@@ d.
I was there not long ago with M@@ ig@@ u@@ el.
He's an amazing gu@@ y, like three parts Char@@ les Dar@@ w@@ in and one part C@@ ro@@ co@@ di@@ le D@@ un@@ de@@ e.
Oka@@ y? There we are s@@ log@@ ging through the w@@ et@@ land@@ s, and I'm pan@@ ting and s@@ we@@ at@@ ing, got mu@@ d up to my k@@ ne@@ es, and M@@ ig@@ u@@ el@@ 's cal@@ m@@ ly con@@ duc@@ ting a biolog@@ y lec@@ ture.
Her@@ e, he's poin@@ ting out a r@@ are Bl@@ ack@@ -@@ sh@@ oul@@ der@@ ed K@@ it@@ e.
Now, he's men@@ tion@@ ing the min@@ er@@ al needs of ph@@ y@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ t@@ on.
And here, here he se@@ es a grou@@ p@@ ing pat@@ tern that re@@ min@@ ds him of the T@@ anz@@ an@@ i@@ an Gi@@ ra@@ ff@@ e.
It turns out, M@@ ig@@ u@@ el spent the better part of his car@@ e@@ er in the M@@ ik@@ um@@ i N@@ ational Par@@ k in Afric@@ a.
I asked him how he became such an exper@@ t on f@@ ish@@ .
He said, "@@ F@@ ish@@ ? I didn't know anything about f@@ ish@@ .
I'm an exper@@ t in relation@@ shi@@ p@@ s."
And then he's off@@ , la@@ un@@ ching into more talk about r@@ are bir@@ ds and al@@ ga@@ es and str@@ ange a@@ qu@@ atic pl@@ ant@@ s.
And don't get me wr@@ ong@@ , that was really fas@@ cin@@ at@@ ing, you know, the bio@@ tic community un@@ pl@@ u@@ g@@ ge@@ d, kind of thing.
It's gre@@ at, but I was in lo@@ ve.
And my head was s@@ wo@@ on@@ ing over that over@@ co@@ o@@ ked piece of del@@ ici@@ ous fish I had the n@@ ight befor@@ e.
So I inter@@ rup@@ ted him@@ . I said, "@@ M@@ ig@@ u@@ el, what makes your fish ta@@ ste so goo@@ d@@ ?"
He poin@@ ted at the al@@ ga@@ e.
"I know, du@@ de, the al@@ ga@@ e, the ph@@ y@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ t@@ on, the relation@@ shi@@ p@@ s: It's amaz@@ ing.
But what are your fish e@@ at@@ ing@@ ?
What's the fe@@ ed con@@ ver@@ sion r@@ ati@@ o@@ ?"
Well, he goes on to tell me it's such a r@@ ich system that the fish are e@@ ating what they@@ 'd be e@@ ating in the wi@@ l@@ d.
The pl@@ ant bi@@ om@@ as@@ s, the ph@@ y@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ t@@ on, the z@@ oo@@ plan@@ k@@ t@@ on, it's what fe@@ eds the f@@ ish@@ .
The system is so health@@ y, it's tot@@ ally self-@@ r@@ ene@@ w@@ ing.
There is no fe@@ ed.
E@@ ver heard of a far@@ m that doesn't fe@@ ed its anim@@ al@@ s?
L@@ ater that day, I was dri@@ ving around this pro@@ per@@ ty with M@@ ig@@ u@@ el, and I asked him@@ , I said, "@@ For a place that seems so natur@@ al, un@@ like like any far@@ m I'd ever been at, how do you meas@@ ure succ@@ ess@@ ?"
At that mom@@ ent, it was as if a fil@@ m direc@@ tor called for a set chang@@ e.
And we ro@@ und@@ ed the cor@@ ner and saw the most amazing s@@ igh@@ t: thousands and thousands of p@@ ink fl@@ am@@ ing@@ o@@ s, a liter@@ al p@@ ink car@@ pe@@ t for as far as you could se@@ e.
"@@ That's succ@@ ess@@ ," he sai@@ d.
"@@ Loo@@ k at their bel@@ li@@ es, p@@ in@@ k.
They're fe@@ ast@@ ing@@ ."
F@@ e@@ ast@@ ing@@ ? I was tot@@ ally conf@@ us@@ ed.
I said, "@@ M@@ ig@@ u@@ el, ar@@ en't they fe@@ ast@@ ing on your f@@ ish@@ ?"
"@@ Y@@ es@@ ," he sai@@ d.
"@@ We lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eg@@ gs to bir@@ ds.
Well, last year, this pro@@ per@@ ty had 6@@ 00@@ ,000 bir@@ ds on it, more than 2@@ 50 different speci@@ es.
It's be@@ com@@ e, today, the lar@@ gest and one of the most important priv@@ ate bir@@ d s@@ anc@@ tu@@ ar@@ ies in all of Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ ."
I said, "@@ M@@ ig@@ u@@ el, isn't a th@@ ri@@ ving bir@@ d population like the last thing you want on a fish far@@ m@@ ?"
He sho@@ ok his he@@ ad, no@@ .
He said, "@@ We far@@ m ex@@ ten@@ si@@ vel@@ y, not inten@@ si@@ vel@@ y.
This is an ec@@ olog@@ ical net@@ work.
The fl@@ am@@ ing@@ os e@@ at the sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p.
The sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p e@@ at the ph@@ y@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ t@@ on.
So the p@@ in@@ ker the b@@ ell@@ y, the better the system@@ ."
Okay, so let's re@@ vie@@ w@@ : a far@@ m that doesn't fe@@ ed its anim@@ als, and a far@@ m that meas@@ ur@@ es its succ@@ ess on the health of its pre@@ dat@@ or@@ s.
A fish far@@ m, but also a bir@@ d s@@ anc@@ tu@@ ar@@ y.
Oh, and by the way, those fl@@ am@@ ing@@ o@@ s, they sh@@ ouldn't even be there in the first plac@@ e.
They bro@@ od in a to@@ wn 1@@ 50 miles a@@ way, where the so@@ il con@@ diti@@ ons are better for building n@@ est@@ s.
E@@ very mor@@ n@@ ing, they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 miles into the far@@ m.
And every ev@@ en@@ ing, they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 miles bac@@ k.
They do that because they're able to fol@@ low the bro@@ ken wh@@ ite line of high@@ way A@@ 9@@ 2@@ .
N@@ o k@@ idd@@ ing.
I was imagin@@ ing a "@@ Mar@@ ch of the P@@ en@@ gu@@ ins@@ " thing, so I looked at M@@ ig@@ u@@ el.
I said, "@@ M@@ ig@@ u@@ el, do they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 miles to the far@@ m, and then do they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 miles back at nigh@@ t?
Do they do that for the childr@@ en@@ ?"
He looked at me like I had just qu@@ o@@ ted a Wh@@ it@@ ne@@ y H@@ ou@@ st@@ on son@@ g.
He said, "@@ No@@ ; they do it because the foo@@ d@@ 's bet@@ ter@@ ."
I didn't men@@ tion the sk@@ in of my bel@@ o@@ ved f@@ is@@ h, which was del@@ ici@@ ous -- and I don't like fish sk@@ in@@ ; I don't like it se@@ ar@@ ed, I don't like it c@@ ris@@ p@@ y.
It's that ac@@ ri@@ d, t@@ ar@@ -@@ like fl@@ a@@ vor@@ .
I almost never co@@ ok with it.
Y@@ et, when I tast@@ ed it at that res@@ tau@@ r@@ ant in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ pa@@ in, it tast@@ ed not at all like fish sk@@ in.
It tast@@ ed s@@ we@@ et and cle@@ an, like you were taking a b@@ ite of the oce@@ an.
I men@@ tion@@ ed that to M@@ ig@@ u@@ el, and he no@@ d@@ de@@ d.
He said, "The sk@@ in ac@@ ts like a sp@@ ong@@ e.
It's the last de@@ f@@ en@@ se before anything en@@ ters the bod@@ y.
It evol@@ ved to so@@ ak up imp@@ ur@@ iti@@ es@@ ."
And then he ad@@ de@@ d, "@@ But our water has no imp@@ ur@@ iti@@ es@@ ."
OK. A far@@ m that doesn't fe@@ ed its f@@ is@@ h, a far@@ m that meas@@ ur@@ es its succ@@ ess by the succ@@ ess of its pre@@ dat@@ or@@ s.
And then I realized when he says, "@@ A far@@ m that has no imp@@ ur@@ iti@@ es@@ ," he made a big under@@ stat@@ em@@ ent, because the water that flo@@ ws through that far@@ m comes in from the Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qu@@ i@@ vi@@ r Ri@@ ver@@ .
It's a ri@@ ver that car@@ ri@@ es with it all the things that ri@@ ver@@ s tend to car@@ ry these da@@ y@@ s: chem@@ ical cont@@ am@@ in@@ ant@@ s, p@@ es@@ tici@@ de run@@ off@@ .
And when it works its way through the system and le@@ av@@ es, the water is cle@@ an@@ er than when it enter@@ ed.
The system is so health@@ y, it pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ es the water.
So, not just a far@@ m that doesn't fe@@ ed its anim@@ als, not just a far@@ m that meas@@ ur@@ es its succ@@ ess by the health of its pre@@ dat@@ or@@ s, but a far@@ m that's liter@@ ally a water pu@@ ri@@ f@@ ic@@ ation pl@@ ant -- and not just for those f@@ is@@ h, but for you and me as well.
Because when that water le@@ av@@ es, it d@@ um@@ ps out into the At@@ lan@@ tic@@ .
A dro@@ p in the oce@@ an, I know, but I'll take it, and so should you, because this love stor@@ y, ho@@ we@@ ver ro@@ man@@ tic@@ , is also in@@ struc@@ tiv@@ e.
You might say it's a re@@ ci@@ pe for the future of good foo@@ d, whether we're talking about bas@@ s or be@@ e@@ f cat@@ tl@@ e.
What we need now is a ra@@ dic@@ ally new conc@@ ep@@ tion of ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ ture, one in which the food actually tast@@ es goo@@ d.
But for a lot people, that's a bit too ra@@ dic@@ al.
We're not real@@ ist@@ s, us foo@@ dies@@ ; we're lo@@ ver@@ s.
We love far@@ mer@@ s@@ ' mark@@ et@@ s, we love small family far@@ m@@ s, we talk about lo@@ cal foo@@ d, we e@@ at organ@@ ic.
And when you sug@@ gest these are the things that will ens@@ ure the future of good foo@@ d, some@@ one, some@@ where stand@@ s up and says, "H@@ ey gu@@ y, I love p@@ ink fl@@ am@@ ing@@ o@@ s, but how are you going to fe@@ ed the world@@ ?"
How are you going to fe@@ ed the world@@ ?
Can I be hon@@ est@@ ?
I don't love that ques@@ tion.
N@@ o, not because we already produ@@ ce enough cal@@ or@@ ies to more than fe@@ ed the world.
One billion people will go h@@ ung@@ ry today.
One billion -- that's more than ever before -- because of gro@@ s@@ s in@@ equ@@ al@@ ities in di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion, not ton@@ n@@ age.
Now, I don't love this question because it's det@@ er@@ min@@ ed the lo@@ gi@@ c of our food system for the last 50 years.
F@@ e@@ ed gra@@ in to her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es, p@@ es@@ tici@@ des to mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tur@@ es, chem@@ ic@@ als to so@@ il@@ , ch@@ ic@@ ken to f@@ is@@ h, and all along ag@@ ri@@ business has simply as@@ k@@ ed, "@@ If we're fe@@ ed@@ ing more people more che@@ a@@ pl@@ y, how terri@@ ble could that be@@ ?"
That's been the mo@@ tiv@@ ation, it's been the ju@@ st@@ ific@@ ation@@ : it's been the business pl@@ an of American ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ ture.
We should call it what it is@@ : a business in li@@ qu@@ id@@ ation, a business that's qu@@ ick@@ ly ero@@ ding ec@@ olog@@ ical cap@@ ital that makes that very produc@@ tion possi@@ ble.
That's not a busin@@ ess, and it isn't ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ ture.
Our bre@@ ad@@ bas@@ k@@ et is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed today, not because of di@@ min@@ ish@@ ing sup@@ pl@@ y, but because of di@@ min@@ ish@@ ing resourc@@ es.
Not by the lat@@ est com@@ b@@ ine and trac@@ tor inv@@ en@@ tion, but by fer@@ ti@@ le land@@ ; not by p@@ ump@@ s, but by f@@ res@@ h wat@@ er@@ ; not by ch@@ ain@@ sa@@ w@@ s, but by for@@ est@@ s@@ ; and not by f@@ ish@@ ing bo@@ at@@ s and net@@ s, but by fish in the se@@ a.
W@@ ant to fe@@ ed the world@@ ?
Let's start by as@@ k@@ ing@@ : How are we going to fe@@ ed our@@ sel@@ v@@ es?
Or bet@@ ter@@ : How can we create con@@ diti@@ ons that en@@ able every community to fe@@ ed it@@ self@@ ?
To do that, don't look at the ag@@ ri@@ business model for the fut@@ ure.
It's really ol@@ d, and it's ti@@ re@@ d.
It's high on cap@@ it@@ al, chem@@ ist@@ ry and mach@@ in@@ es, and it's never produc@@ ed anything really good to e@@ at.
In@@ ste@@ ad, let's look to the ec@@ olog@@ ical model@@ .
That's the one that rel@@ ies on two billion years of on-@@ the@@ -@@ job experi@@ ence.
Loo@@ k to M@@ ig@@ u@@ el, far@@ mer@@ s like M@@ ig@@ u@@ el.
F@@ ar@@ ms that ar@@ en't worl@@ ds un@@ to them@@ sel@@ ves@@ ; far@@ ms that res@@ tor@@ e instead of de@@ pl@@ et@@ e; far@@ ms that far@@ m ex@@ ten@@ si@@ v@@ ely instead of just inten@@ si@@ vel@@ y@@ ; far@@ mer@@ s that are not just produc@@ ers, but exper@@ ts in relation@@ shi@@ p@@ s.
Because they're the ones that are exper@@ ts in fl@@ a@@ vor@@ , to@@ o.
And if I'm going to be really hon@@ es@@ t, they're a better che@@ f than I'll ever be.
You know, I'm ok@@ ay with that, because if that's the future of good foo@@ d, it's going to be del@@ ici@@ ous.
Thank you.
I gre@@ w up on a ste@@ ad@@ y di@@ et of science f@@ ic@@ tion.
In high school@@ , I took a b@@ us to school an h@@ our each way every day.
And I was always ab@@ sor@@ bed in a boo@@ k, science f@@ ic@@ tion boo@@ k, which took my mind to other worl@@ ds, and sat@@ is@@ f@@ ie@@ d, in a n@@ ar@@ r@@ ative form@@ , this ins@@ ati@@ able sense of cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity that I ha@@ d.
And you know, that cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity also man@@ if@@ es@@ ted it@@ self in the fact that wh@@ en@@ ever I wasn't in school I was out in the woo@@ ds, hi@@ king and taking "@@ sam@@ pl@@ es@@ " -- fro@@ gs and s@@ n@@ ak@@ es and bu@@ gs and p@@ ond water -- and bring@@ ing it back, looking at it under the m@@ ic@@ ros@@ cop@@ e.
You know, I was a real science ge@@ ek@@ .
But it was all about trying to understand the world, understand the li@@ mit@@ s of possi@@ bili@@ ty.
And my love of science f@@ ic@@ tion actually seem@@ ed mir@@ r@@ or@@ ed in the world around me, because what was happen@@ ing, this was in the l@@ ate '@@ 60@@ s, we were going to the mo@@ on, we were expl@@ or@@ ing the de@@ ep oce@@ an@@ s.
J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ a@@ u was coming into our living room@@ s with his amazing speci@@ als that sho@@ wed us animals and places and a w@@ on@@ dr@@ ous world that we could never really have pre@@ vi@@ ously imagin@@ ed.
So, that seem@@ ed to res@@ on@@ ate with the whole science f@@ ic@@ tion part of it.
And I was an arti@@ st.
I could dra@@ w. I could pain@@ t.
And I found that because there wer@@ en't video gam@@ es and this sat@@ ur@@ ation of C@@ G mo@@ vi@@ es and all of this imag@@ er@@ y in the medi@@ a land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e, I had to create these imag@@ es in my he@@ ad.
You know, we all di@@ d, as kids having to read a boo@@ k, and through the auth@@ or@@ 's des@@ c@@ rip@@ tion, put something on the mov@@ ie scre@@ en in our head@@ s.
And so, my respon@@ se to this was to pain@@ t, to dra@@ w ali@@ en cre@@ atur@@ es, ali@@ en worl@@ ds, robo@@ ts, spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p@@ s, all that stuff@@ .
I was end@@ l@@ ess@@ ly getting bu@@ st@@ ed in mat@@ h clas@@ s do@@ o@@ d@@ ling behind the tex@@ t@@ boo@@ k.
That was -- the cre@@ ativ@@ ity had to find its out@@ let som@@ eh@@ o@@ w.
And an interesting thing happen@@ ed@@ : The J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ a@@ u shows actually got me very exc@@ ited about the fact that there was an ali@@ en world right here on Ear@@ th.
I might not really go to an ali@@ en world on a spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p some@@ day -- that seem@@ ed pretty dar@@ n un@@ lik@@ el@@ y.
But that was a world I could really go to, right here on Ear@@ th, that was as r@@ ich and ex@@ o@@ tic as anything that I had imagin@@ ed from read@@ ing these bo@@ ok@@ s.
So, I decided I was going to become a sc@@ ub@@ a di@@ ver at the age of 1@@ 5@@ .
And the only problem with that was that I li@@ ved in a little vill@@ age in C@@ an@@ a@@ da, 6@@ 00 miles from the ne@@ ar@@ est oce@@ an.
But I didn't let that da@@ un@@ t me.
I p@@ es@@ ter@@ ed my fa@@ ther until he fin@@ ally found a sc@@ ub@@ a clas@@ s in Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o, New Yor@@ k, right across the bor@@ der from where we li@@ ve.
And I actually got cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ed in a po@@ ol at a Y@@ M@@ C@@ A in the de@@ ad of win@@ ter in Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o, New Yor@@ k.
And I didn't see the oce@@ an, a real oce@@ an, for another two years, until we mo@@ ved to C@@ aliforni@@ a.
Sin@@ ce then, in the inter@@ ven@@ ing 40 years, I've spent about 3@@ ,000 hours under@@ wat@@ er, and 500 hours of that was in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bl@@ es.
And I've learned that that de@@ ep@@ -@@ ocean environ@@ ment, and even the sh@@ allow oce@@ an@@ s, are so r@@ ich with amazing life that really is be@@ y@@ ond our imagin@@ ation.
Nat@@ ure@@ 's imagin@@ ation is so bo@@ und@@ less com@@ par@@ ed to our own me@@ ag@@ er human imagin@@ ation.
I st@@ ill@@ , to this day, stand in absol@@ ute a@@ we of what I see when I make these di@@ ves.
And my love aff@@ air with the ocean is on@@ go@@ ing, and just as str@@ ong as it ever was@@ .
But when I cho@@ se a car@@ e@@ er as an ad@@ ul@@ t, it was fil@@ m@@ mak@@ ing.
And that seem@@ ed to be the best way to re@@ conc@@ ile this ur@@ ge I had to tell stories with my ur@@ g@@ es to create imag@@ es.
And I was, as a ki@@ d, con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly dra@@ wing com@@ ic bo@@ ok@@ s, and so on.
So, fil@@ m@@ making was the way to put pic@@ tures and stories toge@@ ther, and that made sen@@ se.
And of course the stories that I cho@@ se to tell were science f@@ ic@@ tion stor@@ i@@ es@@ : "@@ T@@ er@@ min@@ ator@@ ," "A@@ li@@ ens@@ " and "The Ab@@ y@@ s@@ s."
And with "The Ab@@ y@@ s@@ s@@ ," I was put@@ ting together my love of under@@ water and di@@ ving with fil@@ m@@ mak@@ ing.
So, you know, mer@@ ging the two passi@@ ons.
Som@@ e@@ thing interesting came out of "The Ab@@ y@@ s@@ s@@ ," which was that to sol@@ ve a spec@@ if@@ ic n@@ ar@@ r@@ ative problem on that fil@@ m, which was to create this kind of li@@ qu@@ id water cre@@ at@@ ure, we actually em@@ br@@ ac@@ ed computer gener@@ ated anim@@ ation, C@@ G@@ .
And this resul@@ ted in the first soft@@ -@@ surface charac@@ ter, C@@ G anim@@ ation that was ever in a mo@@ vi@@ e.
And even though the fil@@ m didn't make any money -- bar@@ ely bro@@ ke ev@@ en, I should say -- I wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed something amaz@@ ing, which is that the audi@@ ence, the global audi@@ ence, was mes@@ mer@@ ized by this app@@ ar@@ ent mag@@ ic.
You know, it's Ar@@ th@@ ur C@@ lar@@ k@@ e's la@@ w that any su@@ ff@@ ici@@ ently adv@@ anc@@ ed technology is indi@@ st@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ hab@@ le from mag@@ ic.
They were seeing something mag@@ ic@@ al.
And so that got me very exc@@ it@@ ed.
And I thought, "@@ Wo@@ w, this is something that needs to be em@@ br@@ ac@@ ed into the cin@@ em@@ atic ar@@ t."
So, with "@@ T@@ er@@ min@@ ator 2@@ ," which was my next fil@@ m, we took that much far@@ ther.
Wor@@ king with I@@ L@@ M@@ , we created the li@@ qu@@ id met@@ al du@@ de in that fil@@ m. The succ@@ ess h@@ ung in the bal@@ ance on whether that eff@@ ect would work.
And it di@@ d, and we created mag@@ ic again, and we had the same res@@ ult with an audi@@ ence -- al@@ though we did make a little more money on that one.
So, dra@@ wing a line through those two do@@ ts of experience came to, "@@ This is going to be a whole new world@@ ," this was a whole new world of cre@@ ativ@@ ity for fil@@ m arti@@ st@@ s.
So, I started a company with St@@ an W@@ inst@@ on, my good fri@@ end St@@ an W@@ inst@@ on, who is the pre@@ m@@ ier mak@@ e-@@ up and cre@@ ature design@@ er at that time, and it was called D@@ ig@@ ital D@@ om@@ ain@@ .
And the conc@@ ept of the company was that we would le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g pas@@ t the an@@ al@@ o@@ g proc@@ ess@@ es of op@@ tical pr@@ inter@@ s and so on, and we would go right to dig@@ ital produc@@ tion.
And we actually did that and it gave us a comp@@ et@@ itive adv@@ ant@@ age for a wh@@ il@@ e.
But we found our@@ selves l@@ ag@@ ging in the m@@ id '@@ 9@@ 0@@ s in the cre@@ ature and charac@@ ter design stuff that we had actually fo@@ und@@ ed the company to do.
So, I wrote this piece called "A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ ," which was me@@ ant to absolutely p@@ us@@ h the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e of visu@@ al effec@@ ts, of C@@ G effec@@ ts, be@@ y@@ on@@ d, with real@@ ist@@ ic human emo@@ tive charac@@ ters gener@@ ated in C@@ G@@ , and the ma@@ in charac@@ ters would all be in C@@ G@@ , and the world would be in C@@ G@@ .
And the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e p@@ us@@ h@@ ed back, and I was told by the fol@@ ks at my company that we wer@@ en't going to be able to do this for a wh@@ il@@ e.
So, I sh@@ el@@ ved it, and I made this other mov@@ ie about a big ship that sin@@ k@@ s.
You know, I went and p@@ it@@ ched it to the studi@@ o as "@@ '@@ R@@ om@@ e@@ o and Ju@@ li@@ et@@ ' on a shi@@ p@@ : "@@ It's going to be this ep@@ ic ro@@ man@@ ce, passi@@ on@@ ate fil@@ m@@ ."
S@@ ec@@ re@@ tl@@ y, what I wanted to do was I wanted to di@@ ve to the real w@@ re@@ ck of "@@ Tit@@ an@@ ic@@ ."
And that's why I made the mo@@ vi@@ e.
And that's the tru@@ th. Now, the studi@@ o didn't know that.
But I con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed them. I said, "@@ We're going to di@@ ve to the w@@ re@@ ck@@ . We're going to fil@@ m it for re@@ al.
We@@ 'll be using it in the op@@ en@@ ing of the fil@@ m.
It will be really importan@@ t. It will be a great mark@@ eting ho@@ ok@@ ."
And I talked them into fund@@ ing an ex@@ pe@@ diti@@ on.
So@@ unds cra@@ z@@ y. But this goes back to that them@@ e about your imagin@@ ation cre@@ ating a real@@ ity.
Because we actually created a real@@ ity where six months later, I find myself in a Rus@@ si@@ an sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble two and a half miles down in the nor@@ th At@@ lan@@ tic@@ , looking at the real Tit@@ an@@ ic through a view por@@ t.
Not a mo@@ vi@@ e, not H@@ D -- for re@@ al.
Now, that ble@@ w my min@@ d.
And it took a lot of pre@@ par@@ ation, we had to build camer@@ as and ligh@@ ts and all kinds of things.
Bu@@ t, it stru@@ ck me how much this di@@ ve, these de@@ ep di@@ ves, was like a space mis@@ sion.
You know, where it was high@@ ly techn@@ ic@@ al, and it re@@ qu@@ i@@ red enor@@ m@@ ous pl@@ ann@@ ing.
You get in this cap@@ s@@ ul@@ e, you go down to this dar@@ k ho@@ st@@ ile environ@@ ment where there is no hope of res@@ c@@ ue if you can't get back by your@@ self.
And I thought like, "@@ Wo@@ w. I'm like, living in a science f@@ ic@@ tion mo@@ vi@@ e.
This is really cool@@ ."
And so, I really got bit@@ ten by the bu@@ g of de@@ ep@@ -@@ ocean expl@@ or@@ ation.
O@@ f course, the cu@@ ri@@ o@@ sit@@ y, the science comp@@ on@@ ent of it -- it was every@@ thing. It was adv@@ ent@@ ure, it was cu@@ ri@@ o@@ sit@@ y, it was imagin@@ ation.
And it was an experience that H@@ oll@@ y@@ w@@ ood couldn't give me.
Bec@@ ause, you know, I could imagine a cre@@ ature and we could create a visu@@ al eff@@ ect for it. But I couldn't imagine what I was seeing out that win@@ do@@ w.
As we did some of our sub@@ sequ@@ ent ex@@ pe@@ dition@@ s, I was seeing cre@@ atur@@ es at hy@@ dro@@ ther@@ mal v@@ ents and sometimes things that I had never seen befor@@ e, sometimes things that no one had seen befor@@ e, that actually were not descri@@ bed by science at the time that we saw them and imag@@ ed them.
So, I was completely s@@ mit@@ ten by this, and had to do mor@@ e.
And so, I actually made a kind of cu@@ ri@@ ous dec@@ isi@@ on.
Af@@ ter the succ@@ ess of "@@ Tit@@ an@@ ic@@ ," I said, "@@ OK, I'm going to par@@ k my day job as a H@@ oll@@ y@@ w@@ ood mov@@ ie mak@@ er, and I'm going to go be a ful@@ l@@ -@@ time expl@@ or@@ er for a wh@@ il@@ e."
And so, we started pl@@ ann@@ ing these ex@@ pe@@ dition@@ s.
And we w@@ o@@ und up going to the B@@ is@@ mar@@ k, and expl@@ or@@ ing it with robo@@ tic v@@ eh@@ ic@@ l@@ es.
We went back to the Tit@@ an@@ ic w@@ re@@ ck@@ .
We took little bo@@ ts that we had created that sp@@ ool@@ ed a fi@@ ber op@@ tic@@ .
And the idea was to go in and do an inter@@ i@@ or sur@@ v@@ ey of that shi@@ p, which had never been don@@ e.
No@@ body had ever looked inside the w@@ re@@ ck@@ . They didn't have the means to do it, so we created technology to do it.
So, you know, here I am now, on the de@@ ck of Tit@@ an@@ ic, sitting in a sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bl@@ e, and looking out at plan@@ ks that look much like this, where I knew that the b@@ and had play@@ ed.
And I'm fl@@ ying a little robo@@ tic v@@ eh@@ ic@@ le through the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or of the shi@@ p.
When I say, "@@ I'm oper@@ ating it@@ ," but my mind is in the v@@ eh@@ ic@@ le.
I felt like I was physic@@ ally pres@@ ent inside the shi@@ p@@ w@@ re@@ ck of Tit@@ an@@ ic.
And it was the most sur@@ real kind of de@@ j@@ a v@@ u experience I've ever ha@@ d, because I would know before I turned a cor@@ ner what was going to be there before the ligh@@ ts of the v@@ eh@@ ic@@ le actually re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed it, because I had wal@@ ked the set for months when we were making the mo@@ vi@@ e.
And the set was based as an ex@@ act rep@@ lic@@ a on the bl@@ u@@ e@@ prin@@ ts of the shi@@ p.
So, it was this absolutely re@@ mark@@ able experi@@ ence.
And it really made me real@@ ize that the tel@@ ep@@ res@@ ence experience -- that you actually can have these robo@@ tic av@@ at@@ ar@@ s, then your con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness is in@@ jec@@ ted into the v@@ eh@@ ic@@ le, into this other form of exist@@ ence.
It was really, really quite prof@@ oun@@ d.
And it may be a little bit of a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se as to what might be happening some dec@@ a@@ des out as we start to have cy@@ bor@@ g bo@@ dies for expl@@ or@@ ation or for other means in many sort of po@@ st-@@ human fut@@ ur@@ es that I can imag@@ ine, as a science f@@ ic@@ tion f@@ an.
So, having done these ex@@ pe@@ dition@@ s, and really beginning to app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate what was down there, such as at the de@@ ep ocean v@@ ents where we had these amaz@@ ing, amazing animals -- they're basically ali@@ ens right here on Ear@@ th.
They live in an environ@@ ment of ch@@ emo@@ syn@@ thes@@ is.
They don't survi@@ ve on sun@@ ligh@@ t-@@ based system the way we do.
And so, you're seeing animals that are living next to water pl@@ um@@ es.
You think they can't possi@@ bly ex@@ ist.
At the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well -- again, it's the science f@@ ic@@ tion in@@ flu@@ ence, as a ki@@ d.
And I w@@ o@@ und up getting invol@@ ved with the space commun@@ ity, really invol@@ ved with N@@ AS@@ A, sitting on the N@@ AS@@ A ad@@ vis@@ ory bo@@ ar@@ d, pl@@ ann@@ ing actu@@ al space mis@@ sion@@ s, going to Rus@@ si@@ a, going through the pre@@ -@@ co@@ s@@ mon@@ au@@ t bi@@ om@@ e@@ dic@@ al pro@@ to@@ col@@ s, and all these sor@@ ts of things, to actually go and f@@ ly to the intern@@ ational space st@@ ation with our 3@@ D camer@@ a system@@ s.
And this was fas@@ cin@@ at@@ ing.
But what I w@@ o@@ und up doing was bring@@ ing space scienti@@ sts with us into the de@@ ep@@ .
And taking them down so that they had acc@@ ess -- ast@@ ro@@ biolog@@ ist@@ s, plan@@ et@@ ary scienti@@ st@@ s, people who were interested in these extre@@ me environ@@ ments -- taking them down to the v@@ ents, and let@@ ting them see, and take sam@@ pl@@ es and test in@@ strum@@ ents, and so on.
So, here we were making doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ary fil@@ m@@ s, but actually doing sci@@ ence, and actually doing space sci@@ ence.
I'd completely clos@@ ed the loo@@ p between being the science f@@ ic@@ tion f@@ an, you know, as a ki@@ d, and doing this stuff for re@@ al.
And you know, along the way in this jour@@ ne@@ y of discover@@ y, I learned a lo@@ t.
I learned a lot about sci@@ ence. But I also learned a lot about lea@@ der@@ shi@@ p.
Now you think direc@@ tor has got to be a lea@@ der, lea@@ der of, cap@@ tain of the shi@@ p, and all that sort of thing.
I didn't really learn about lea@@ der@@ ship until I did these ex@@ pe@@ dition@@ s.
Because I had to, at a certain poin@@ t, say, "What am I doing out her@@ e?
Why am I doing this@@ ? What do I get out of it@@ ?"
We don't make money at these dam@@ n sho@@ w@@ s.
We bar@@ ely bre@@ ak ev@@ en. There is no f@@ ame in it.
People sort of think I went away between "@@ Tit@@ an@@ ic@@ " and "A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ " and was bu@@ ff@@ ing my n@@ ail@@ s some@@ plac@@ e, sitting at the be@@ ach@@ .
Ma@@ de all these fil@@ m@@ s, made all these doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ary fil@@ ms for a very li@@ mit@@ ed audi@@ ence.
N@@ o fam@@ e, no gl@@ or@@ y, no mone@@ y. What are you do@@ ing@@ ?
You're doing it for the t@@ ask it@@ self, for the chall@@ enge -- and the ocean is the most chall@@ eng@@ ing environ@@ ment there is -- for the th@@ ri@@ ll of discover@@ y, and for that str@@ ange b@@ ond that happens when a small group of people form a ti@@ gh@@ tly kn@@ it te@@ am.
Because we would do these things with 10@@ , 12 people, working for years at a time, sometimes at se@@ a for tw@@ o, three months at a time.
And in that b@@ on@@ d, you real@@ ize that the most important thing is the resp@@ ect that you have for them and that they have for you, that you've done a t@@ ask that you can't ex@@ pla@@ in to someone el@@ se.
When you come back to the sh@@ ore and you say, "@@ We had to do this, and the fi@@ ber op@@ tic@@ , and the att@@ ent@@ u@@ ation, and the this and the that, all the technology of it, and the diffic@@ ul@@ ty, the human@@ -@@ per@@ for@@ man@@ ce as@@ pec@@ ts of working at se@@ a@@ ," you can't ex@@ pla@@ in it to people. It's that thing that maybe co@@ ps ha@@ ve, or people in com@@ b@@ at that have gone through something together and they know they can never ex@@ pla@@ in it.
C@@ re@@ ates a b@@ on@@ d, cre@@ ates a b@@ ond of resp@@ ec@@ t.
So, when I came back to make my next mo@@ vi@@ e, which was "A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ ," I tried to ap@@ ply that same prin@@ ci@@ ple of lea@@ der@@ shi@@ p, which is that you resp@@ ect your te@@ am, and you ear@@ n their resp@@ ect in re@@ tur@@ n.
And it really chang@@ ed the dynam@@ ic.
So, here I was ag@@ ain with a small te@@ am, in un@@ char@@ ted ter@@ rit@@ or@@ y, doing "A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ ," coming up with new technology that didn't ex@@ ist befor@@ e.
T@@ re@@ m@@ end@@ ously exc@@ it@@ ing.
T@@ re@@ m@@ end@@ ously chall@@ eng@@ ing.
And we became a fam@@ il@@ y, over a four@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ half year peri@@ o@@ d.
And it completely chang@@ ed how I do mo@@ vi@@ es.
So, people have comm@@ ented on ho@@ w, "Well, you know, you brought back the ocean organis@@ ms and put them on the planet of P@@ and@@ or@@ a@@ ."
To me, it was more of a fundament@@ al way of doing busin@@ ess, the process it@@ self, that chang@@ ed as a res@@ ult of that.
So, what can we syn@@ thes@@ ize out of all this@@ ?
You know, what are the l@@ ess@@ ons lear@@ ne@@ d?
Well, I think number one is cu@@ ri@@ o@@ sit@@ y.
It's the most powerful thing you ow@@ n.
I@@ mag@@ in@@ ation is a force that can actually man@@ if@@ est a real@@ ity.
And the resp@@ ect of your te@@ am is more important than all the lau@@ rel@@ s in the world.
I have young fil@@ m@@ mak@@ ers come up to me and say, "@@ Gi@@ ve me some ad@@ vice for doing this@@ ."
And I say, "@@ D@@ on't put li@@ mit@@ ations on your@@ self.
O@@ ther people will do that for you -- don't do it to your@@ self, don't be@@ t against your@@ self, and take ris@@ k@@ s."
N@@ AS@@ A has this p@@ hr@@ ase that they lik@@ e: "@@ F@@ ail@@ ure is not an op@@ tion@@ ."
But fail@@ ure has to be an op@@ tion in art and in expl@@ or@@ ation, because it's a lea@@ p of fa@@ i@@ th.
And no important en@@ de@@ a@@ vor that re@@ qu@@ i@@ red innov@@ ation was done without ris@@ k.
You have to be will@@ ing to take those ris@@ k@@ s.
So, that's the thought I would leave you with@@ , is that in whatever you're do@@ ing, fail@@ ure is an op@@ tion, but fe@@ ar is no@@ t. Thank you.
If I can leave you with one big idea today, it's that the whole of the data in which we consum@@ e is gre@@ ater that the s@@ um of the par@@ ts, and instead of thinking about information over@@ lo@@ ad, what I'd like you to think about is how we can use information so that pat@@ ter@@ ns po@@ p and we can see tr@@ ends that would other@@ wis@@ e be inv@@ isi@@ ble.
So what we're looking at right here is a ty@@ pic@@ al mor@@ tal@@ ity char@@ t organ@@ ized by age.
This to@@ ol that I'm using here is a little experim@@ ent.
It's called P@@ i@@ vo@@ t, and with P@@ i@@ vo@@ t what I can do is I can ch@@ oo@@ se to fil@@ ter in one particular c@@ ause of de@@ ath@@ s -- say, ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents.
And, right a@@ way, I see there's a different pat@@ tern that em@@ er@@ ges@@ .
This is bec@@ ause, in the m@@ id@@ -@@ area here, people are at their most activ@@ e, and over here they're at their most f@@ ra@@ il@@ .
We can ste@@ p back out ag@@ ain and then re@@ organ@@ ize the data by c@@ ause of de@@ a@@ th, seeing that cir@@ cul@@ at@@ ory diseas@@ es and canc@@ er are the us@@ ual s@@ us@@ pec@@ ts, but not for every@@ one.
If we go ah@@ e@@ ad and we fil@@ ter by age -- say 40 years or less -- we see that ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents are actually the great@@ est c@@ ause that people have to be wor@@ ri@@ ed ab@@ out.
And if you dri@@ ll into that, it's es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally the case for m@@ en.
So you get the idea that vie@@ wing inform@@ ation, vie@@ wing data in this way, is a lot like s@@ wi@@ mm@@ ing in a living information in@@ fo@@ -@@ gra@@ ph@@ ic.
And if we can do this for ra@@ w dat@@ a, why not do it for cont@@ ent as well@@ ?
So what we have right here is the cover of every single Sp@@ or@@ ts I@@ ll@@ u@@ str@@ ated ever produc@@ ed.
It's all her@@ e; it's all on the web@@ .
You can go back to your room@@ s and try this after my tal@@ k.
W@@ ith P@@ i@@ vo@@ t, you can dri@@ ll into a dec@@ ad@@ e.
You can dri@@ ll into a particular year.
You can j@@ um@@ p right into a spec@@ if@@ ic issu@@ e.
So I'm looking at this@@ ; I see the ath@@ let@@ es that have appear@@ ed in this issu@@ e, the sp@@ ort@@ s.
I'm a L@@ ance Ar@@ m@@ str@@ ong f@@ an, so I'll go ah@@ e@@ ad and I'll cli@@ ck on that, which re@@ ve@@ als, for me, all the issu@@ es in which L@@ ance Ar@@ m@@ str@@ ong@@ 's been a part of@@ .
Now, if I want to just kind of take a pe@@ ek at thes@@ e, I might think, "Well, what about taking a look at all of cy@@ cl@@ ing@@ ?"
So I can ste@@ p back, and exp@@ and on that.
And I see Gre@@ g Le@@ Mon@@ d now.
And so you get the idea that when you n@@ av@@ ig@@ ate over information this way -- going n@@ ar@@ ro@@ wer@@ , bro@@ a@@ der, bac@@ king in, bac@@ king out -- you're not se@@ ar@@ ch@@ ing, you're not bro@@ w@@ s@@ ing.
You're doing something that's actually a little bit differ@@ ent.
It's in bet@@ we@@ en, and we think it chang@@ es the way information can be us@@ ed.
So I want to extra@@ pol@@ ate on this idea a bit with something that's a little bit cra@@ z@@ y.
What we're done here is we've taken every single W@@ ik@@ i@@ pedi@@ a p@@ age and we re@@ duc@@ ed it down to a little sum@@ mar@@ y.
So the sum@@ mar@@ y consi@@ sts of just a little sy@@ no@@ p@@ s@@ is and an ic@@ on to in@@ dic@@ ate the to@@ pic@@ al area that it comes fro@@ m.
I'm only sho@@ wing the top 500 most popul@@ ar W@@ ik@@ i@@ pedi@@ a p@@ ages right here.
But even in this li@@ mit@@ ed vie@@ w, we can do a lot of things.
R@@ ight a@@ way, we get a sense of what are the to@@ pic@@ al dom@@ ain@@ s that are most popul@@ ar on W@@ ik@@ i@@ pedi@@ a.
I'm going to go ah@@ e@@ ad and sel@@ ect govern@@ ment.
Now, having sel@@ ected govern@@ ment, I can now see that the W@@ ik@@ i@@ pedi@@ a cat@@ eg@@ or@@ ies that most fre@@ qu@@ ently cor@@ respon@@ d to that are Tim@@ e mag@@ az@@ ine People of the Y@@ ear@@ .
So this is really important because this is an ins@@ ight that was not con@@ tain@@ ed within any one W@@ ik@@ i@@ pedi@@ a p@@ age.
It's only possible to see that ins@@ ight when you ste@@ p back and look at all of them.
Loo@@ king at one of these particular sum@@ mar@@ ies, I can then dri@@ ll into the conc@@ ept of Tim@@ e mag@@ az@@ ine Per@@ son of the Y@@ ear@@ , bring@@ ing up all of them.
So looking at these people, I can see that the maj@@ or@@ ity come from govern@@ ment@@ ; some have come from natural sci@@ enc@@ es@@ ; som@@ e, fe@@ wer st@@ ill@@ , have come from business -- there's my bo@@ s@@ s -- and one has come from mus@@ ic.
And interest@@ ing@@ ly en@@ ough@@ , B@@ on@@ o is also a TED Pri@@ ze w@@ inn@@ er.
So we can go@@ , j@@ um@@ p, and take a look at all the TED Pri@@ ze w@@ inn@@ er@@ s.
So you see, we're n@@ av@@ ig@@ ating the we@@ b for the first time as if it's actually a web@@ , not from p@@ ag@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ p@@ age, but at a high@@ er level of ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tion.
And so I want to show you one other thing that may cat@@ ch you a little bit by sur@@ pris@@ e.
I'm just sho@@ wing the New York Tim@@ es web@@ site here.
So P@@ i@@ vo@@ t, this app@@ lic@@ ation -- I don't want to call it a bro@@ w@@ ser@@ ; it's really not a bro@@ w@@ ser@@ , but you can view we@@ b p@@ ages with it -- and we bring that zo@@ om@@ able technology to every single we@@ b p@@ age like this.
So I can ste@@ p back, po@@ p right back into a spec@@ if@@ ic sec@@ tion.
Now the reason why this is important is bec@@ ause, by virtu@@ e of just vie@@ wing we@@ b p@@ ages in this way, I can look at my entire bro@@ w@@ sing history in the ex@@ act same way.
So I can dri@@ ll into what I've done over spec@@ if@@ ic time fr@@ am@@ es.
Her@@ e, in fact, is the state of all the dem@@ o that I just ga@@ ve.
And I can sort of re@@ play some stuff that I was looking at ear@@ li@@ er today.
And, if I want to ste@@ p back and look at every@@ thing, I can sli@@ ce and di@@ ce my histor@@ y, perhaps by my se@@ ar@@ ch history -- here, I was doing some ne@@ po@@ ti@@ st@@ ic se@@ ar@@ ch@@ ing, looking for B@@ ing, over here for Li@@ ve L@@ ab@@ s P@@ i@@ vo@@ t.
And from thes@@ e, I can dri@@ ll into the we@@ b p@@ age and just la@@ unch them again.
It's one met@@ ap@@ h@@ or re@@ pur@@ posed mul@@ ti@@ ple tim@@ es, and in each case it makes the whole gre@@ ater than the s@@ um of the parts with the dat@@ a.
So right now, in this world, we think about data as being this cur@@ se.
We talk about the cur@@ se of information over@@ lo@@ ad.
We talk about dro@@ w@@ ning in dat@@ a.
What if we can actually turn that up@@ side down and turn the we@@ b up@@ side down, so that instead of n@@ av@@ ig@@ ating from one thing to the nex@@ t, we get used to the hab@@ it of being able to go from many things to many things, and then being able to see the pat@@ ter@@ ns that were other@@ wis@@ e hi@@ d@@ den@@ ?
If we can do that, then instead of being tra@@ pped in dat@@ a, we might actually ex@@ tr@@ act inform@@ ation.
And, instead of de@@ al@@ ing just with inform@@ ation, we can te@@ ase out knowle@@ d@@ ge.
And if we get the knowle@@ d@@ ge, then maybe even there's wis@@ dom to be f@@ oun@@ d.
So with that, I thank you.
Every@@ body tal@@ ks about happin@@ ess these da@@ ys.
I had somebody coun@@ t the number of boo@@ ks with "@@ happin@@ ess@@ " in the tit@@ le publi@@ sh@@ ed in the last five years and they gave up after about 4@@ 0@@ , and there were many mor@@ e.
There is a huge wa@@ ve of inter@@ est in happin@@ ess, am@@ ong resear@@ ch@@ ers.
There is a lot of happin@@ ess co@@ ach@@ ing.
Every@@ body would like to make people happ@@ ier@@ .
But in sp@@ ite of all this f@@ loo@@ d of work, there are sever@@ al cogn@@ itive tra@@ ps that sort of make it almost im@@ possible to think stra@@ ight about happin@@ ess.
And my talk today will be mo@@ st@@ ly about these cogn@@ itive tra@@ p@@ s.
This app@@ li@@ es to la@@ y@@ people thinking about their own happin@@ ess, and it app@@ li@@ es to sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ s thinking about happin@@ ess, because it turns out we're just as mess@@ ed up as any@@ body else is.
The first of these tra@@ ps is a rel@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ ance to ad@@ mit compl@@ ex@@ ity.
It turns out that the word "@@ happin@@ ess@@ " is just not a us@@ e@@ ful word any@@ mor@@ e, because we ap@@ ply it to too many different things.
I think there is one particular mean@@ ing to which we might res@@ tri@@ c@@ t it, but by and lar@@ ge, this is something that we'll have to give up and we'll have to a@@ do@@ p@@ t the more comp@@ lic@@ ated view of what well@@ -@@ being is.
The second tra@@ p is a conf@@ us@@ ion between experience and mem@@ or@@ y@@ ; bas@@ ic@@ ally, it's between being happy in your life, and being happy about your life or happy with your life.
And those are two very different conc@@ ep@@ ts, and they're both l@@ ump@@ ed in the no@@ tion of happin@@ ess.
And the third is the foc@@ using ill@@ usi@@ on, and it's the un@@ fortun@@ ate fact that we can't think about any cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ ance that aff@@ ec@@ ts well@@ -@@ being without di@@ stor@@ ting its import@@ anc@@ e.
I mean, this is a real cogn@@ itive tra@@ p.
There's just no way of getting it right.
Now, I'd like to start with an example of somebody who had a ques@@ tion@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ answer s@@ es@@ sion after one of my lec@@ tures re@@ por@@ ted a stor@@ y, and that was a story -- He said he@@ 'd been li@@ sten@@ ing to a sy@@ m@@ ph@@ on@@ y, and it was absolutely gl@@ ori@@ ous music and at the very end of the rec@@ ord@@ ing, there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful scre@@ ech@@ ing so@@ und.
And then he ad@@ de@@ d, really quite emo@@ tion@@ ally, it ru@@ in@@ ed the whole experi@@ ence.
But it ha@@ dn@@ '@@ t.
What it had ru@@ in@@ ed were the mem@@ or@@ ies of the experi@@ ence.
He had had the experi@@ ence.
He had had 20 minutes of gl@@ ori@@ ous mus@@ ic.
They coun@@ ted for nothing because he was left with a mem@@ or@@ y@@ ; the mem@@ ory was ru@@ in@@ ed, and the mem@@ ory was all that he had go@@ tten to ke@@ ep@@ .
What this is tell@@ ing us, really, is that we might be thinking of our@@ selves and of other people in terms of two sel@@ ves.
There is an experi@@ enc@@ ing self, who lives in the pres@@ ent and kno@@ ws the pres@@ ent, is cap@@ able of re@@ -@@ living the pa@@ st, but basically it has only the pres@@ ent.
It's the experi@@ enc@@ ing self that the doc@@ tor appro@@ ach@@ es -- you know, when the doc@@ tor as@@ k@@ s, "@@ Do@@ es it h@@ ur@@ t now when I tou@@ ch you her@@ e@@ ?"
And then there is a remem@@ ber@@ ing self, and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self is the one that ke@@ ep@@ s sc@@ or@@ e, and ma@@ in@@ ta@@ ins the story of our life, and it's the one that the doc@@ tor appro@@ ach@@ es in as@@ king the ques@@ tion, "@@ How have you been feel@@ ing lat@@ el@@ y@@ ?"
or "@@ How was your tri@@ p to Al@@ ban@@ i@@ a@@ ?" or something like that.
Th@@ o@@ se are two very different ent@@ iti@@ es, the experi@@ enc@@ ing self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self, and getting conf@@ used between them is part of the m@@ ess about the no@@ tion of happin@@ ess.
Now, the remem@@ ber@@ ing self is a stor@@ y@@ tell@@ er.
And that really star@@ ts with a bas@@ ic respon@@ se of our mem@@ or@@ ies -- it star@@ ts im@@ medi@@ at@@ el@@ y.
We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stor@@ i@@ es.
Our mem@@ ory tell@@ s us stor@@ ies, that is, what we get to keep from our experi@@ ences is a story.
And let me beg@@ in with one exampl@@ e.
This is an old stud@@ y.
Th@@ o@@ se are actu@@ al pati@@ ents under@@ going a pain@@ ful proc@@ e@@ du@@ re.
I won't go into det@@ ail@@ . It's no longer pain@@ ful these da@@ ys, but it was pain@@ ful when this study was run in the 199@@ 0@@ s.
They were asked to rep@@ ort on their pa@@ in every 60 secon@@ ds.
Here are two pati@@ ents, those are their rec@@ ord@@ ing@@ s.
And you are as@@ k@@ ed, "@@ Wh@@ o of them su@@ ffer@@ ed mor@@ e@@ ?"
And it's a very eas@@ y ques@@ tion.
C@@ lear@@ ly, P@@ ati@@ ent B su@@ ffer@@ ed more -- his col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y was long@@ er, and every min@@ ute of pa@@ in that P@@ ati@@ ent A ha@@ d, P@@ ati@@ ent B ha@@ d, and mor@@ e.
But now there is another ques@@ tion@@ : "@@ How much did these pati@@ ents think they su@@ ffer@@ ed@@ ?"
And here is a sur@@ pris@@ e.
The sur@@ pr@@ ise is that P@@ ati@@ ent A had a much wor@@ se mem@@ ory of the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y than P@@ ati@@ ent B@@ .
The stories of the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ ies were differ@@ ent, and because a very crit@@ ical part of the story is how it end@@ s.
And n@@ ei@@ ther of these stories is very in@@ spir@@ ing or great -- but one of them is this dist@@ inc@@ t ... but one of them is dist@@ inc@@ tly wor@@ se than the other.
And the one that is wor@@ se is the one where pa@@ in was at its pe@@ ak at the very end@@ ; it's a bad story.
How do we know that?
Because we asked these people after their col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y, and much later, to@@ o, "@@ How bad was the whole thing, in to@@ tal@@ ?"
And it was much wor@@ se for A than for B@@ , in mem@@ or@@ y.
Now this is a direc@@ t conf@@ lic@@ t between the experi@@ enc@@ ing self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self.
F@@ rom the point of view of the experi@@ enc@@ ing self, clear@@ ly, B had a wor@@ se time.
Now, what you could do with P@@ ati@@ ent A, and we actually r@@ an c@@ lin@@ ical experim@@ ents, and it has been don@@ e, and it does work -- you could actually ex@@ tend the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y of P@@ ati@@ ent A by just ke@@ ep@@ ing the tu@@ be in without j@@ ig@@ gl@@ ing it too much.
That will c@@ ause the pati@@ ent to su@@ ff@@ er, but just a little and much less than befor@@ e.
And if you do that for a couple of minut@@ es, you have made the experi@@ enc@@ ing self of P@@ ati@@ ent A wor@@ se off@@ , and you have the remem@@ ber@@ ing self of P@@ ati@@ ent A a lot better off@@ , because now you have en@@ dow@@ ed P@@ ati@@ ent A with a better story about his experi@@ ence.
What defin@@ es a stor@@ y?
And that is true of the stories that mem@@ ory del@@ i@@ ver@@ s for us, and it's also true of the stories that we make up.
What defin@@ es a story are chan@@ ges@@ , sign@@ ific@@ ant mom@@ ents and end@@ ing@@ s.
En@@ d@@ ings are very, very important and, in this cas@@ e, the end@@ ing dom@@ in@@ at@@ ed.
Now, the experi@@ enc@@ ing self lives its life contin@@ u@@ ous@@ ly.
It has mom@@ ents of experi@@ ence, one after the other.
And you can as@@ k@@ : What happens to these mom@@ ent@@ s?
And the answer is really stra@@ igh@@ t@@ for@@ war@@ d@@ : They are lo@@ st for@@ ever@@ .
I mean, most of the mom@@ ents of our life -- and I cal@@ cul@@ at@@ ed, you know, the psych@@ olog@@ ical pres@@ ent is said to be about three secon@@ ds long@@ ; that means that, you know, in a life there are about 6@@ 00 million of them@@ ; in a mon@@ th, there are about 6@@ 00@@ ,000 -- most of them don't leave a trac@@ e.
Mo@@ st of them are completely ign@@ or@@ ed by the remem@@ ber@@ ing self.
And y@@ et, som@@ eh@@ ow you get the sense that they should coun@@ t, that what happens during these mom@@ ents of experience is our life.
It's the fin@@ ite res@@ ource that we're sp@@ end@@ ing while we're on this ear@@ th.
And how to spend it would se@@ em to be rel@@ ev@@ an@@ t, but that is not the story that the remem@@ ber@@ ing self ke@@ ep@@ s for us.
So we have the remem@@ ber@@ ing self and the experi@@ enc@@ ing self, and they're really quite dist@@ inc@@ t.
The big@@ gest differ@@ ence between them is in the hand@@ ling of time.
F@@ rom the point of view of the experi@@ enc@@ ing self, if you have a v@@ ac@@ ation, and the second we@@ ek is just as good as the fir@@ st, then the t@@ wo@@ -@@ we@@ ek v@@ ac@@ ation is t@@ wi@@ ce as good as the on@@ e-@@ we@@ ek v@@ ac@@ ation.
That's not the way it works at all for the remem@@ ber@@ ing self.
For the remem@@ ber@@ ing self, a t@@ wo@@ -@@ we@@ ek v@@ ac@@ ation is bar@@ ely better than the on@@ e-@@ we@@ ek v@@ ac@@ ation because there are no new mem@@ or@@ ies ad@@ de@@ d.
You have not chang@@ ed the story.
And in this way, time is actually the crit@@ ical vari@@ able that dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ish@@ es a remem@@ ber@@ ing self from an experi@@ enc@@ ing self@@ ; time has very little imp@@ act on the story.
Now, the remem@@ ber@@ ing self does more than remember and tell stor@@ i@@ es.
It is actually the one that makes dec@@ isi@@ ons bec@@ ause, if you have a pati@@ ent who has ha@@ d, say, two col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ ies with two different sur@@ ge@@ ons and is deci@@ ding which of them to ch@@ oo@@ se, then the one that ch@@ oo@@ ses is the one that has the mem@@ ory that is less b@@ ad, and that's the sur@@ ge@@ on that will be cho@@ s@@ en.
The experi@@ enc@@ ing self has no vo@@ ice in this cho@@ ic@@ e.
We actually don't ch@@ oo@@ se between experi@@ enc@@ es, we ch@@ oo@@ se between mem@@ or@@ ies of experi@@ enc@@ es.
And even when we think about the fut@@ ure, we don't think of our future norm@@ ally as experi@@ enc@@ es.
We think of our future as anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated mem@@ ori@@ es.
And basically you can look at this, you know, as a ty@@ r@@ ann@@ y of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self, and you can think of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self sort of dr@@ ag@@ ging the experi@@ enc@@ ing self through experi@@ ences that the experi@@ enc@@ ing self doesn't ne@@ ed.
I have that sense that when we go on v@@ ac@@ ations this is very fre@@ qu@@ ently the cas@@ e; that is, we go on v@@ ac@@ ations, to a very large ex@@ ten@@ t, in the ser@@ vice of our remem@@ ber@@ ing self.
And this is a bit hard to ju@@ st@@ if@@ y I thin@@ k.
I mean, how much do we consum@@ e our mem@@ ori@@ es?
That is one of the ex@@ plan@@ ations that is given for the dom@@ in@@ ance of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self.
And when I think about that, I think about a v@@ ac@@ ation we had in Ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic@@ a a few years ago, which was clear@@ ly the best v@@ ac@@ ation I've ever ha@@ d, and I think of it rel@@ ativ@@ ely of@@ ten, rel@@ ative to how much I think of other v@@ ac@@ ations.
And I probably have consum@@ ed my mem@@ or@@ ies of that thre@@ e-@@ we@@ ek tri@@ p, I would say, for about 25 minutes in the last four years.
Now, if I had ever op@@ en@@ ed the fol@@ der with the 6@@ 00 pic@@ tures in it, I would have spent another hour@@ .
Now, that is three week@@ s, and that is at most an h@@ our and a hal@@ f.
There seems to be a dis@@ cre@@ p@@ anc@@ y.
Now, I may be a bit extre@@ me, you know, in how little app@@ et@@ ite I have for consum@@ ing mem@@ ori@@ es, but even if you do more of this, there is a gen@@ u@@ ine ques@@ tion@@ : Why do we put so much wei@@ ght on mem@@ ory rel@@ ative to the wei@@ ght that we put on experi@@ enc@@ es?
So I want you to think about a thought experim@@ ent.
I@@ mag@@ ine that for your next v@@ ac@@ ation, you know that at the end of the v@@ ac@@ ation all your pic@@ tures will be des@@ tro@@ y@@ ed, and you'll get an am@@ n@@ es@@ ic dru@@ g so that you won't remember any@@ thing.
Now, would you ch@@ oo@@ se the same v@@ ac@@ ation@@ ? And if you would ch@@ oo@@ se a different v@@ ac@@ ation, there is a conf@@ lic@@ t between your two sel@@ ves, and you need to think about how to ad@@ ju@@ dic@@ ate that conf@@ lic@@ t, and it's actually not at all obvi@@ ou@@ s, because if you think in terms of time, then you get one answer@@ , and if you think in terms of mem@@ ori@@ es, you might get another answer@@ .
Why do we pic@@ k the v@@ ac@@ ations we do is a problem that con@@ fron@@ ts us with a cho@@ ice between the two sel@@ ves.
Now, the two selves bring up two no@@ tions of happin@@ ess.
There are really two conc@@ ep@@ ts of happin@@ ess that we can ap@@ pl@@ y, one per self.
So you can as@@ k@@ : How happy is the experi@@ enc@@ ing self@@ ?
And then you would as@@ k@@ : How happy are the mom@@ ents in the experi@@ enc@@ ing self@@ 's li@@ fe@@ ?
And they're all -- happin@@ ess for mom@@ ents is a fa@@ ir@@ ly comp@@ lic@@ ated proc@@ ess.
What are the emo@@ tions that can be meas@@ ure@@ d?
And, by the way, now we are cap@@ able of getting a pretty good idea of the happin@@ ess of the experi@@ enc@@ ing self over time.
If you ask for the happin@@ ess of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self, it's a completely different thing.
This is not about how happ@@ ily a person li@@ ves.
It is about how sat@@ is@@ fi@@ ed or pleas@@ ed the person is when that person thin@@ ks about her life.
Ver@@ y different no@@ tion.
An@@ y@@ one who doesn't dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ish those no@@ tions is going to m@@ ess up the study of happin@@ ess, and I bel@@ ong to a cro@@ w@@ d of students of well@@ -@@ bein@@ g, who@@ 've been mess@@ ing up the study of happin@@ ess for a long time in pre@@ cis@@ ely this way.
The dist@@ inc@@ tion between the happin@@ ess of the experi@@ enc@@ ing self and the sat@@ is@@ fac@@ tion of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self has been recogn@@ ized in rec@@ ent years, and there are now eff@@ or@@ ts to meas@@ ure the two se@@ par@@ at@@ el@@ y.
The G@@ all@@ up Or@@ gan@@ iz@@ ation has a world pol@@ l where more than half a million people have been asked ques@@ tions about what they think of their life and about their experi@@ enc@@ es, and there have been other eff@@ or@@ ts along those lin@@ es.
So in rec@@ ent years, we have be@@ gu@@ n to learn about the happin@@ ess of the two sel@@ ves.
And the ma@@ in l@@ ess@@ on I think that we have learned is they are really differ@@ ent.
You can know how sat@@ is@@ fi@@ ed somebody is with their life, and that really doesn't te@@ ach you much about how happ@@ ily they're living their life, and vice ver@@ sa@@ .
Just to give you a sense of the cor@@ rel@@ ation, the cor@@ rel@@ ation is about .@@ 5@@ .
What that means is if you met som@@ ebo@@ d@@ y, and you were t@@ ol@@ d, "@@ O@@ h his fa@@ ther is six feet t@@ all@@ ," how much would you know about his hei@@ gh@@ t?
Well, you would know something about his hei@@ gh@@ t, but there's a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty.
You have that much un@@ certain@@ ty.
If I tell you that somebody ran@@ ked their life eight on a sc@@ ale of ten, you have a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about how happy they are with their experi@@ enc@@ ing self.
So the cor@@ rel@@ ation is lo@@ w.
We know something about what contro@@ ls sat@@ is@@ fac@@ tion of the happin@@ ess self.
We know that money is very importan@@ t, go@@ als are very importan@@ t.
We know that happin@@ ess is ma@@ in@@ ly being sat@@ is@@ fi@@ ed with people that we like, sp@@ end@@ ing time with people that we lik@@ e.
There are other pleas@@ ur@@ es, but this is dom@@ in@@ an@@ t.
So if you want to ma@@ x@@ im@@ ize the happin@@ ess of the two sel@@ ves, you are going to end up doing very different things.
The bo@@ t@@ tom line of what I've said here is that we really should not think of happin@@ ess as a sub@@ st@@ itu@@ te for well@@ -@@ bein@@ g.
It is a completely different no@@ tion.
Now, very qu@@ ic@@ kl@@ y, another reason we cannot think stra@@ ight about happin@@ ess is that we do not atten@@ d to the same things when we think about life, and we actually li@@ ve.
So, if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in C@@ aliforni@@ a, you are not going to get to the cor@@ rec@@ t answer@@ .
When you ask that ques@@ tion, you think people must be happ@@ ier in C@@ aliforni@@ a if@@ , say, you live in O@@ hi@@ o.
And what happens is when you think about living in C@@ aliforni@@ a, you are thinking of the con@@ tr@@ ast between C@@ aliforni@@ a and other plac@@ es, and that con@@ tra@@ st, say, is in cli@@ mat@@ e.
Well, it turns out that climate is not very important to the experi@@ enc@@ ing self and it's not even very important to the ref@@ lec@@ tive self that deci@@ des how happy people are.
But now, because the ref@@ lec@@ tive self is in char@@ ge, you may end up -- some people may end up moving to C@@ aliforni@@ a.
And it's sort of interesting to tr@@ ace what is going to happen to people who move to C@@ aliforni@@ a in the hope of getting happ@@ ier@@ .
Well, their experi@@ enc@@ ing self is not going to get happ@@ ier@@ .
We know that.
But one thing will happen@@ : They will think they are happ@@ ier@@ , bec@@ ause, when they think about it, they@@ 'll be re@@ min@@ ded of how hor@@ ri@@ ble the we@@ a@@ ther was in O@@ hi@@ o, and they will feel they made the right dec@@ isi@@ on.
It is very diffic@@ ult to think stra@@ ight about well@@ -@@ bein@@ g, and I hope I have given you a sense of how diffic@@ ult it is.
Thank you.
Chris Ander@@ son@@ : Thank you. I've got a question for you.
Thank you so much.
Now, when we were on the phone a few week@@ s ago, you men@@ tion@@ ed to me that there was quite an interesting res@@ ult came out of that G@@ all@@ up sur@@ ve@@ y.
Is that something you can share since you do have a few mom@@ ents left no@@ w@@ ?
Dan@@ ie@@ l K@@ ah@@ n@@ em@@ an@@ : Su@@ re.
I think the most interesting res@@ ult that we found in the G@@ all@@ up sur@@ v@@ ey is a num@@ ber, which we absolutely did not exp@@ ect to fin@@ d.
We found that with resp@@ ect to the happin@@ ess of the experi@@ enc@@ ing self.
When we looked at how feel@@ ing@@ s, v@@ ary with in@@ com@@ e.
And it turns out that, bel@@ ow an in@@ come of 60@@ ,000 dollars a year, for Americ@@ ans -- and that's a very large sam@@ ple of Americ@@ an@@ s, like 6@@ 00@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ , so it's a large repres@@ ent@@ ative sam@@ ple -- bel@@ ow an in@@ come of 6@@ 00@@ ,000 dollars a year@@ ...
CA: 60@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ .
D@@ K@@ : 60@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ .
60@@ ,000 dollars a year, people are un@@ happ@@ y, and they get progr@@ es@@ si@@ v@@ ely un@@ happ@@ ier the po@@ or@@ er they get@@ .
A@@ bo@@ ve that, we get an absolutely fl@@ at lin@@ e.
I mean I've r@@ ar@@ ely seen lin@@ es so fl@@ at.
C@@ lear@@ ly, what is happening is money does not buy you experi@@ enti@@ al happin@@ ess, but l@@ ack of money certain@@ ly bu@@ ys you mis@@ er@@ y, and we can meas@@ ure that mis@@ er@@ y very, very clear@@ ly.
In terms of the other self, the remem@@ ber@@ ing self, you get a different story.
The more money you ear@@ n, the more sat@@ is@@ fi@@ ed you are.
That does not hold for emo@@ tions.
CA: But D@@ ann@@ y, the whole American en@@ de@@ a@@ vor is about life, li@@ ber@@ ty, the pur@@ su@@ it of happin@@ ess.
If people took seri@@ ously that fin@@ d@@ ing, I mean, it seems to turn up@@ side down everything we believe ab@@ out, like for example, ta@@ x@@ ation po@@ lic@@ y and so for@@ th.
Is there any ch@@ ance that poli@@ tici@@ an@@ s, that the country gener@@ ally, would take a fin@@ ding like that seri@@ ously and run public po@@ lic@@ y based on it?
D@@ K@@ : You know I think that there is recogn@@ ition of the ro@@ le of happin@@ ess research in public po@@ lic@@ y.
The recogn@@ ition is going to be s@@ low in the United Stat@@ es, no question about that, but in the U.@@ K@@ .@@ , it is happen@@ ing, and in other countries it is happen@@ ing.
People are recogn@@ iz@@ ing that they ought to be thinking of happin@@ ess when they think of public po@@ lic@@ y.
It's going to take a wh@@ il@@ e, and people are going to de@@ b@@ ate whether they want to study experience happin@@ ess, or whether they want to study life ev@@ al@@ u@@ ation, so we need to have that de@@ b@@ ate fa@@ ir@@ ly so@@ on.
How to enh@@ ance happin@@ ess goes very different ways dep@@ end@@ ing on how you think, and whether you think of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self or you think of the experi@@ enc@@ ing self.
This is going to in@@ flu@@ ence po@@ lic@@ y, I think, in years to com@@ e.
In the United Stat@@ es, eff@@ or@@ ts are being made to meas@@ ure the experience happin@@ ess of the popul@@ ation.
This is going to be, I think, within the next dec@@ ade or tw@@ o, part of n@@ ational st@@ atist@@ ic@@ s.
CA: Well, it seems to me that this issu@@ e will -- or at least should be -- the most interesting po@@ lic@@ y dis@@ c@@ us@@ sion to tr@@ ack over the next few years.
Thank you so much for inv@@ ent@@ ing behavi@@ or@@ al econom@@ ic@@ s.
Thank you, D@@ ann@@ y K@@ ah@@ n@@ em@@ an.
I'm going to talk today about energy and cli@@ mat@@ e.
And that might se@@ em a bit sur@@ pris@@ ing because my ful@@ l@@ -@@ time work at the Fo@@ und@@ ation is mo@@ st@@ ly about v@@ acc@@ ines and se@@ ed@@ s, about the things that we need to inv@@ ent and del@@ i@@ ver to help the po@@ or@@ est two billion live better li@@ ves.
But energy and climate are extre@@ m@@ ely important to these people -- in fact, more important than to any@@ one else on the plan@@ et.
The climate getting wor@@ se means that many years, their cro@@ ps won't grow@@ : There will be too much ra@@ in, not enough ra@@ in, things will change in ways that their frag@@ ile environ@@ ment simply can't supp@@ or@@ t.
And that le@@ ad@@ s to star@@ v@@ ation, it le@@ ad@@ s to un@@ certain@@ ty, it le@@ ad@@ s to un@@ res@@ t.
So, the climate chang@@ es will be terri@@ ble for them.
Al@@ so, the pri@@ ce of energy is very important to them.
In fact, if you could pic@@ k just one thing to lo@@ wer the pri@@ ce of, to redu@@ ce po@@ ver@@ ty, by far you would pic@@ k energ@@ y.
Now, the pri@@ ce of energy has come down over time.
Re@@ ally adv@@ anc@@ ed civi@@ liz@@ ation is based on adv@@ anc@@ es in energ@@ y.
The co@@ al re@@ volution fu@@ el@@ ed the In@@ du@@ stri@@ al R@@ evol@@ u@@ tion, and, even in the 19@@ 00@@ s we've seen a very ra@@ pi@@ d de@@ cl@@ ine in the pri@@ ce of electri@@ c@@ ity, and that's why we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator@@ s, air@@ -@@ con@@ dition@@ ing, we can make mo@@ dern materi@@ als and do so many things.
And so, we're in a wonderful s@@ ituation with electri@@ city in the r@@ ich world.
Bu@@ t, as we make it che@@ aper -- and let's go for making it t@@ wi@@ ce as che@@ a@@ p -- we need to me@@ et a new con@@ stra@@ in@@ t, and that con@@ stra@@ in@@ t has to do with CO@@ 2@@ .
CO@@ 2 is war@@ m@@ ing the plan@@ et, and the equ@@ ation on CO@@ 2 is actually a very stra@@ igh@@ t@@ for@@ ward one.
If you s@@ um up the CO@@ 2 that gets em@@ it@@ ted, that le@@ ad@@ s to a tem@@ per@@ ature increas@@ e, and that tem@@ per@@ ature incre@@ ase le@@ ad@@ s to some very neg@@ ative effec@@ ts@@ : the effec@@ ts on the we@@ a@@ ther@@ ; perhaps wor@@ se, the indi@@ rec@@ t effec@@ ts, in that the natural ec@@ o@@ systems can't ad@@ just to these ra@@ pi@@ d chan@@ ges@@ , and so you get ec@@ o@@ system coll@@ ap@@ s@@ es.
Now, the ex@@ act amount of how you ma@@ p from a certain incre@@ ase of CO@@ 2 to what tem@@ per@@ ature will be and where the positi@@ ve fe@@ ed@@ bac@@ ks are, there's some un@@ certain@@ ty there, but not very much.
And there's certain@@ ly un@@ certain@@ ty about how bad those effec@@ ts will be, but they will be extre@@ m@@ ely b@@ ad.
I asked the top scienti@@ sts on this sever@@ al tim@@ es@@ : Do we really have to get down to ne@@ ar zer@@ o@@ ?
C@@ an@@ 't we just cut it in half or a qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ ?
And the answer is that until we get ne@@ ar to zer@@ o, the tem@@ per@@ ature will contin@@ ue to ris@@ e.
And so that's a big chall@@ eng@@ e.
It's very different than saying "@@ We're a t@@ wel@@ v@@ e-@@ foo@@ t-@@ high tru@@ ck trying to get under a ten@@ -@@ foo@@ t bri@@ d@@ ge, and we can just sort of squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze under@@ ."
This is something that has to get to zer@@ o.
Now, we put out a lot of carb@@ on di@@ ox@@ i@@ de every year, over 2@@ 6 billion ton@@ s.
For each Americ@@ an, it's about 20 ton@@ s@@ ; for people in po@@ or countri@@ es, it's less than one t@@ on.
It's an aver@@ age of about five t@@ ons for everyone on the plan@@ et.
And, som@@ eh@@ o@@ w, we have to make chang@@ es that will bring that down to zer@@ o.
It's been con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly going up.
It's only vari@@ ous economic chang@@ es that have even fl@@ atten@@ ed it at all, so we have to go from ra@@ p@@ id@@ ly ris@@ ing to fall@@ ing, and fall@@ ing all the way to zer@@ o.
This equ@@ ation has four fac@@ tor@@ s, a little bit of mul@@ ti@@ p@@ lic@@ ation@@ : So, you've got a thing on the le@@ ft, CO@@ 2@@ , that you want to get to zer@@ o, and that's going to be based on the number of people, the ser@@ vic@@ es each person@@ 's using on aver@@ age, the energy on aver@@ age for each ser@@ vic@@ e, and the CO@@ 2 being put out per un@@ it of energ@@ y.
So, let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zer@@ o.
Pro@@ bab@@ ly, one of these num@@ bers is going to have to get pretty ne@@ ar to zer@@ o.
Now that's back from high school al@@ ge@@ b@@ ra@@ , but let's take a loo@@ k.
Fir@@ st, we've got popul@@ ation.
The world today has 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people.
That's head@@ ed up to about n@@ ine billi@@ on.
Now, if we do a really great job on new v@@ acc@@ in@@ es, health car@@ e, re@@ produc@@ tive health ser@@ vic@@ es, we could lo@@ wer that b@@ y, per@@ ha@@ p@@ s, 10 or 15 perc@@ ent, but there we see an incre@@ ase of about 1@@ .@@ 3@@ .
The second fac@@ tor is the ser@@ vic@@ es we us@@ e.
This en@@ com@@ pas@@ ses every@@ thing@@ : the food we e@@ at, clo@@ thing, T@@ V@@ , he@@ at@@ ing.
These are very good thing@@ s: getting ri@@ d of po@@ ver@@ ty means provi@@ ding these ser@@ vic@@ es to almost everyone on the plan@@ et.
And it's a great thing for this number to go up.
In the r@@ ich world, perhaps the top one billi@@ on, we probably could cut back and use l@@ ess, but every year, this num@@ ber, on aver@@ age, is going to go up, and so, over all, that will more than d@@ ou@@ ble the ser@@ vic@@ es del@@ i@@ ver@@ ed per person@@ .
Here we have a very bas@@ ic ser@@ vic@@ e: Do you have ligh@@ ting in your h@@ ouse to be able to read your hom@@ e@@ work@@ ?
And, in fact, these kids don@@ '@@ t, so they're going out and read@@ ing their school work under the stre@@ et l@@ amp@@ s.
Now, eff@@ ici@@ enc@@ y, E@@ , the energy for each ser@@ vic@@ e, here fin@@ ally we have some good new@@ s.
We have something that's not going up.
Th@@ r@@ ough vari@@ ous inv@@ en@@ tions and new ways of doing ligh@@ t@@ ing, through different typ@@ es of car@@ s, different ways of building build@@ ings -- there are a lot of ser@@ vic@@ es where you can bring the energy for that ser@@ vice down quite sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ ally.
Some individu@@ al ser@@ vic@@ es even bring it down by 9@@ 0 perc@@ ent.
There are other ser@@ vic@@ es like how we make fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ er, or how we do air tran@@ sp@@ or@@ t, where the room@@ s for impro@@ v@@ ement are far@@ , far l@@ ess.
And so, over@@ all here, if we're op@@ tim@@ ist@@ ic, we may get a re@@ duc@@ tion of a fac@@ tor of three to ev@@ en, per@@ ha@@ p@@ s, a fac@@ tor of si@@ x@@ .
But for these first three fac@@ tors now, we've gone from 2@@ 6 billion to, at bes@@ t, maybe 1@@ 3 billion ton@@ s, and that just won't cut it.
So let's look at this four@@ th fac@@ tor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of CO@@ 2 put out per each un@@ it of energ@@ y.
And so the question is@@ : Can you actually get that to zer@@ o@@ ?
If you bur@@ n co@@ al, no@@ .
If you bur@@ n natural g@@ as, no@@ .
Al@@ most every way we make electri@@ city today, exc@@ ept for the em@@ erg@@ ing r@@ ene@@ w@@ ab@@ les and nu@@ clear@@ , put@@ s out CO@@ 2@@ .
And so, what we're going to have to do at a global scal@@ e, is create a new system.
And so, we need energy mir@@ ac@@ l@@ es.
Now, when I use the ter@@ m "@@ mir@@ ac@@ le@@ ," I don't mean something that's im@@ possi@@ ble.
The m@@ icro@@ proc@@ ess@@ or is a mir@@ ac@@ le. The person@@ al computer is a mir@@ ac@@ le.
The Internet and its ser@@ vic@@ es are a mir@@ ac@@ le.
So, the people here have par@@ tici@@ p@@ ated in the cre@@ ation of many mir@@ ac@@ l@@ es.
U@@ su@@ ally, we don't have a de@@ ad@@ lin@@ e, where you have to get the mir@@ ac@@ le by a certain dat@@ e.
U@@ su@@ ally, you just kind of stand b@@ y, and some come al@@ ong@@ , some don@@ '@@ t.
This is a case where we actually have to dri@@ ve at full spe@@ ed and get a mir@@ ac@@ le in a pretty ti@@ ght tim@@ el@@ ine.
Now, I thought, "@@ How could I really cap@@ ture this@@ ?
Is there some kind of natural ill@@ u@@ str@@ ation, some de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation that would gra@@ b peopl@@ e's imagin@@ ation her@@ e@@ ?"
I thought back to a year ago when I brought mo@@ squ@@ it@@ o@@ s, and som@@ eh@@ ow people en@@ jo@@ y@@ ed that.
It really got them invol@@ ved in the idea of, you know, there are people who live with mo@@ squ@@ it@@ o@@ s.
So, with energ@@ y, all I could come up with is this.
I decided that rel@@ eas@@ ing fi@@ ref@@ li@@ es would be my con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion to the environ@@ ment here this year.
So here we have some natural fi@@ ref@@ li@@ es.
I'm told they don't bit@@ e; in fact, they might not even leave that j@@ ar@@ .
Now, there's all sor@@ ts of g@@ imm@@ ick@@ y sol@@ u@@ tions like that one, but they don't really ad@@ d up to much.
We need sol@@ u@@ tions -- ei@@ ther one or sever@@ al -- that have un@@ belie@@ v@@ able sc@@ ale and un@@ belie@@ v@@ able rel@@ i@@ abili@@ ty, and, al@@ though there's many direc@@ tions people are se@@ ek@@ ing, I really only see five that can achie@@ ve the big num@@ ber@@ s.
I've left out ti@@ de, ge@@ other@@ m@@ al, f@@ usi@@ on, bi@@ of@@ u@@ el@@ s.
Th@@ o@@ se may make some con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion, and if they can do better than I exp@@ ec@@ t, so much the bet@@ ter, but my key point here is that we're going to have to work on each of these fi@@ ve, and we can't give up any of them because they look da@@ un@@ t@@ ing, because they all have sign@@ ific@@ ant chall@@ en@@ ges@@ .
Let's look first at the bur@@ ning f@@ os@@ si@@ l fu@@ el@@ s, ei@@ ther bur@@ ning co@@ al or bur@@ ning natural g@@ as.
What you need to do there, seems like it might be simpl@@ e, but it's no@@ t, and that's to take all the CO@@ 2@@ , after you've bur@@ ned it, going out the flu@@ e, pres@@ su@@ ri@@ ze it, create a li@@ qu@@ i@@ d, put it some@@ wher@@ e, and hope it sta@@ ys there.
Now we have some p@@ ilo@@ t things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level@@ , but getting up to that full perc@@ ent@@ age, that will be very tri@@ ck@@ y, and agre@@ ein@@ g on where these CO@@ 2 qu@@ ant@@ ities should be put will be har@@ d, but the t@@ ough@@ est one here is this long@@ -@@ ter@@ m issu@@ e.
W@@ ho@@ 's going to be su@@ re@@ ?
W@@ ho@@ 's going to gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e something that is liter@@ ally billi@@ ons of times lar@@ ger than any ty@@ pe of wa@@ ste you think of in terms of nu@@ clear or other thing@@ s?
This is a lot of vol@@ um@@ e.
So that's a t@@ ough one.
N@@ ex@@ t would be nu@@ clear@@ .
It also has three big problem@@ s: Co@@ st, partic@@ ular@@ ly in high@@ ly reg@@ ul@@ ated countri@@ es, is high@@ ; the issu@@ e of the sa@@ f@@ et@@ y, really feel@@ ing good about nothing could go wr@@ ong@@ , that, even though you have these human oper@@ ator@@ s, that the fu@@ el doesn't get used for we@@ ap@@ ons.
And then what do you do with the wa@@ st@@ e?
And, al@@ though it's not very lar@@ ge, there are a lot of conc@@ ern@@ s about that.
People need to feel good about it.
So three very t@@ ough problems that might be sol@@ v@@ able, and so, should be worked on.
The last three of the fi@@ ve, I've grou@@ p@@ ed toge@@ ther.
These are what people often ref@@ er to as the r@@ ene@@ w@@ able s@@ ourc@@ es.
And they actually -- al@@ though it's great they don't re@@ qu@@ ire fu@@ el -- they have some dis@@ adv@@ ant@@ ag@@ es.
One is that the den@@ s@@ ity of energy ga@@ ther@@ ed in these technologi@@ es is dr@@ am@@ ati@@ c@@ ally less than a power plan@@ t.
This is energy far@@ m@@ ing, so you're talking about many squ@@ are mil@@ es, thousands of time more area than you think of as a nor@@ mal energy plan@@ t.
Al@@ so, these are inter@@ mit@@ t@@ ent s@@ ourc@@ es.
The su@@ n doesn't sh@@ ine all day, it doesn't sh@@ ine every day, and, lik@@ e@@ wis@@ e, the w@@ ind doesn't b@@ low all the time.
And so, if you dep@@ end on these s@@ ourc@@ es, you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time peri@@ o@@ ds that it's not av@@ ail@@ able.
So, we've got big cost chall@@ eng@@ es here, we have trans@@ mis@@ sion chall@@ en@@ ges@@ : for example, say this energy s@@ ource is outside your countr@@ y@@ ; you not only need the technolog@@ y, but you have to deal with the ris@@ k of the energy coming from el@@ se@@ wher@@ e.
And, fin@@ ally, this stor@@ age problem.
And, to dimension@@ al@@ ize this, I went through and looked at all the typ@@ es of b@@ atter@@ ies that get made -- for car@@ s, for compu@@ ter@@ s, for ph@@ on@@ es, for f@@ las@@ h@@ ligh@@ ts, for everything -- and com@@ par@@ ed that to the amount of electri@@ cal energy the world us@@ es, and what I found is that all the b@@ atter@@ ies we make now could stor@@ e less than 10 minutes of all the energ@@ y.
And so, in fact, we need a big bre@@ ak@@ through here, something that's going to be a fac@@ tor of 100 better than the appro@@ ach@@ es we have now.
It's not im@@ possi@@ bl@@ e, but it's not a very eas@@ y thing.
Now, this shows up when you try to get the inter@@ mit@@ t@@ ent s@@ ource to be abo@@ ve, say, 20 to 30 percent of what you're us@@ ing.
If you're coun@@ ting on it for 100 perc@@ ent, you need an incredible mir@@ ac@@ le b@@ atter@@ y.
Now, how we're going to go for@@ ward on this -- what's the right appro@@ ach@@ ?
Is it a Man@@ hat@@ t@@ an Pro@@ jec@@ t? What's the thing that can get us ther@@ e?
Well, we need lots of compan@@ ies working on this, hundre@@ ds.
In each of these five pa@@ th@@ s, we need at least a hund@@ red people.
And a lot of them, you'll look at and say, "@@ They're cra@@ z@@ y." That's goo@@ d.
And, I think, here in the TED grou@@ p, we have many people who are already pur@@ su@@ ing this.
B@@ ill G@@ ross has sever@@ al compan@@ ies, inclu@@ ding one called e@@ Sol@@ ar that has some great sol@@ ar ther@@ mal technologi@@ es.
V@@ in@@ od K@@ ho@@ s@@ la@@ 's inves@@ ting in do@@ z@@ ens of compan@@ ies that are doing great things and have interesting possi@@ bili@@ ti@@ es, and I'm trying to help back that.
N@@ a@@ than M@@ y@@ hr@@ v@@ old and I actually are bac@@ king a company that, perhaps sur@@ pris@@ ing@@ ly, is actually taking the nu@@ clear appro@@ ach@@ .
There are some innov@@ ations in nu@@ clear@@ : mod@@ ul@@ ar, li@@ qu@@ i@@ d.
And innov@@ ation really sto@@ pped in this industr@@ y quite some ago, so the idea that there's some good ideas la@@ ying around is not all that sur@@ pris@@ ing.
The idea of T@@ er@@ ra@@ Po@@ wer is that, instead of bur@@ ning a part of ur@@ an@@ i@@ um -- the one perc@@ ent, which is the U@@ 2@@ 3@@ 5 -- we deci@@ de@@ d, "@@ Let's bur@@ n the 9@@ 9 perc@@ ent, the U@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8@@ ."
It is kind of a cra@@ z@@ y ide@@ a.
In fact, people had talked about it for a long time, but they could never sim@@ ul@@ ate pro@@ per@@ ly whether it would work or no@@ t, and so it's through the adv@@ ent of mo@@ dern super@@ compu@@ ters that now you can sim@@ ul@@ ate and see that, y@@ es, with the right materi@@ al@@ 's appro@@ ach@@ , this looks like it would work.
And, because you're bur@@ ning that 9@@ 9 perc@@ ent, you have great@@ ly impro@@ ved cost pro@@ fil@@ e.
You actually bur@@ n up the wa@@ st@@ e, and you can actually use as fu@@ el all the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver wa@@ ste from to@@ da@@ y's re@@ ac@@ tor@@ s.
So, instead of wor@@ r@@ ying about them, you just take that. It's a great thing.
It bre@@ ath@@ es this ur@@ an@@ i@@ um as it goes al@@ ong@@ , so it's kind of like a c@@ and@@ le.
You can see it's a lo@@ g there, often re@@ fer@@ red to as a tra@@ vel@@ ing wa@@ ve re@@ ac@@ tor@@ .
In terms of fu@@ el, this really sol@@ ves the problem.
I've got a picture here of a place in K@@ ent@@ u@@ ck@@ y.
This is the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver, the 9@@ 9 perc@@ ent, where they've taken out the part they bur@@ n now, so it's called de@@ pl@@ et@@ ed ur@@ an@@ i@@ um.
That would power the U.S. for hundre@@ ds of years.
And, simply by fil@@ ter@@ ing se@@ a@@ water in an in@@ exp@@ en@@ sive proc@@ ess, you@@ 'd have enough fu@@ el for the entire li@@ fe@@ time of the rest of the plan@@ et.
So, you know, it's got lots of chall@@ eng@@ es ah@@ e@@ ad, but it is an example of the many hundre@@ ds and hundre@@ ds of ideas that we need to move for@@ war@@ d.
So let's think@@ : How should we meas@@ ure our@@ sel@@ v@@ es?
What should our rep@@ ort car@@ d look lik@@ e?
Well, let's go out to where we really need to get@@ , and then look at the inter@@ medi@@ ate.
For 20@@ 50@@ , you've heard many people talk about this 80 percent re@@ duc@@ tion.
That really is very importan@@ t, that we get there.
And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in po@@ or countri@@ es, still some ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ ture, ho@@ pe@@ fully we will have cle@@ an@@ ed up for@@ es@@ tr@@ y, c@@ em@@ ent.
So, to get to that 80 perc@@ ent, the develop@@ ed countri@@ es, inclu@@ ding countries like Chin@@ a, will have had to s@@ wit@@ ch their electri@@ city gener@@ ation al@@ toge@@ ther.
So, the other gra@@ de is@@ : A@@ re we de@@ plo@@ ying this zer@@ o-@@ em@@ is@@ sion technolog@@ y, have we de@@ plo@@ y@@ ed it in all the develop@@ ed countries and we're in the process of getting it el@@ se@@ wher@@ e?
That's su@@ per importan@@ t.
That's a key el@@ ement of making that rep@@ ort car@@ d.
So, bac@@ king up from there, what should the 20@@ 20 rep@@ ort car@@ d look lik@@ e?
Well, again, it should have the two el@@ em@@ ents.
We should go through these eff@@ ici@@ enc@@ y meas@@ ur@@ es to start getting re@@ duc@@ tion@@ s: The less we em@@ it, the less that s@@ um will be of CO@@ 2@@ , and, there@@ for@@ e, the less the tem@@ per@@ at@@ ure.
But in some wa@@ ys, the gra@@ de we get there, doing things that don't get us all the way to the big re@@ duc@@ tions, is only equ@@ ally, or maybe even s@@ ligh@@ tly l@@ ess, important than the other@@ , which is the piece of innov@@ ation on these bre@@ ak@@ through@@ s.
These bre@@ ak@@ through@@ s, we need to move those at full spe@@ ed, and we can meas@@ ure that in terms of compan@@ ies, p@@ ilo@@ t projec@@ ts, reg@@ ul@@ at@@ ory things that have been chan@@ ge@@ d.
There's a lot of great boo@@ ks that have been writ@@ ten about this.
The A@@ l G@@ ore boo@@ k, "@@ Our C@@ ho@@ ic@@ e@@ " and the David Mc@@ K@@ ay boo@@ k, "@@ Su@@ stain@@ able En@@ erg@@ y Wi@@ th@@ out the Ho@@ t A@@ ir@@ ."
They really go through it and create a fr@@ am@@ e@@ work that this can be dis@@ c@@ us@@ sed bro@@ ad@@ ly, because we need bro@@ ad bac@@ king for this.
There's a lot that has to come toge@@ ther.
So this is a wis@@ h.
It's a very con@@ cre@@ te wis@@ h that we inv@@ ent this technolog@@ y.
If you gave me only one wis@@ h for the next 50 years -- I could pic@@ k who's pres@@ iden@@ t, I could pic@@ k a v@@ acc@@ ine, which is something I lo@@ ve, or I could pic@@ k that this thing that's half the cost with no CO@@ 2 gets inv@@ ented -- this is the wis@@ h I would pic@@ k.
This is the one with the great@@ est imp@@ ac@@ t.
If we don't get this wis@@ h, the di@@ vis@@ ion between the people who think sh@@ ort ter@@ m and long ter@@ m will be terri@@ bl@@ e, between the U.S. and Chin@@ a, between po@@ or countries and rich@@ , and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far wor@@ se.
So, what do we have to do@@ ?
What am I appe@@ al@@ ing to you to ste@@ p for@@ ward and dri@@ v@@ e?
We need to go for more research fund@@ ing.
When countries get together in places like C@@ op@@ enh@@ ag@@ en, they sh@@ ouldn't just dis@@ c@@ us@@ s the CO@@ 2@@ .
They should dis@@ c@@ us@@ s this innov@@ ation ag@@ en@@ da, and you@@ 'd be st@@ un@@ ned at the ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ously low level@@ s of sp@@ end@@ ing on these innov@@ ative appro@@ ach@@ es.
We do need the market inc@@ enti@@ ves -- CO@@ 2 ta@@ x@@ , c@@ a@@ p and tra@@ de -- something that gets that pri@@ ce sign@@ al out there.
We need to get the mes@@ sage out.
We need to have this di@@ al@@ og@@ ue be a more r@@ ation@@ al, more under@@ stand@@ able di@@ al@@ og@@ u@@ e, inclu@@ ding the st@@ ep@@ s that the government ta@@ k@@ es.
This is an important wis@@ h, but it is one I think we can achie@@ ve.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Ander@@ son@@ : Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. So to understand more about T@@ er@@ ra@@ Po@@ wer@@ , right -- I mean, first of all, can you give a sense of what sc@@ ale of inv@@ est@@ ment this is@@ ?
Bi@@ l G@@ at@@ es@@ : To actually do the soft@@ war@@ e, buy the super@@ compu@@ ter, h@@ ire all the great scienti@@ st@@ s, which we've don@@ e, that's only tens of milli@@ ons, and even once we test our materi@@ als out in a Rus@@ si@@ an re@@ ac@@ tor to make sure that our materi@@ als work pro@@ per@@ ly, then you'll only be up in the hundre@@ ds of milli@@ ons.
The t@@ ough thing is building the p@@ ilo@@ t re@@ ac@@ tor@@ ; fin@@ ding the sever@@ al billi@@ on, fin@@ ding the reg@@ ul@@ at@@ or, the lo@@ c@@ ation that will actually build the first one of thes@@ e.
On@@ ce you get the first one buil@@ t, if it works as ad@@ ver@@ t@@ is@@ ed, then it's just clear as day, because the econom@@ ic@@ s, the energy den@@ sit@@ y, are so different than nu@@ clear as we know it.
CA: And so, to understand it right, this invol@@ ves building de@@ ep into the gro@@ und almost like a ver@@ tical kind of col@@ um@@ n of nu@@ clear fu@@ el, of this sort of spent ur@@ an@@ i@@ um, and then the process star@@ ts at the top and kind of works dow@@ n@@ ?
B@@ G: That's right. To@@ day, you're always re@@ fu@@ el@@ ing the re@@ ac@@ tor@@ , so you have lots of people and lots of contro@@ ls that can go wr@@ ong@@ : that thing where you're op@@ en@@ ing it up and moving things in and out, that's not goo@@ d.
So, if you have very che@@ a@@ p fu@@ el that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a lo@@ g -- put it down and not have those same compl@@ ex@@ iti@@ es.
And it just s@@ its there and bur@@ ns for the 60 years, and then it's don@@ e.
CA: It's a nu@@ clear power pl@@ ant that is its own wa@@ ste dis@@ pos@@ al sol@@ u@@ tion.
B@@ G: Ye@@ ah. Well, what happens with the wa@@ st@@ e, you can let it s@@ it there -- there's a lot less wa@@ ste under this appro@@ ach -- then you can actually take that, and put it into another one and bur@@ n that.
And we start off actually by taking the wa@@ ste that exist@@ s today, that's sitting in these cool@@ ing po@@ ol@@ s or dr@@ y cas@@ king by re@@ ac@@ tors -- that's our fu@@ el to beg@@ in with@@ .
So, the thing that's been a problem from those re@@ ac@@ tors is actually what gets f@@ ed into our@@ s, and you're re@@ duc@@ ing the vol@@ um@@ e of the wa@@ ste quite dr@@ am@@ ati@@ c@@ ally as you're going through this proc@@ ess.
CA: I mean, you're talking to different people around the world about the possi@@ bili@@ ties here.
W@@ here is there most inter@@ est in actually doing something with this@@ ?
B@@ G: Well, we ha@@ ven@@ 't pic@@ ked a particular plac@@ e, and there's all these interesting dis@@ clos@@ ure rul@@ es about anything that's called "@@ nu@@ clear@@ ," so we've got a lot of interes@@ t, that people from the company have been in Rus@@ si@@ a, Indi@@ a, China -- I've been back seeing the sec@@ re@@ t@@ ary of energy here, talking about how this f@@ its into the energy ag@@ en@@ da@@ .
So I'm op@@ tim@@ ist@@ ic. You know, the Fr@@ en@@ ch and Jap@@ an@@ ese have done some work.
This is a vari@@ ant on something that has been don@@ e.
It's an important adv@@ ance, but it's like a fast re@@ ac@@ tor@@ , and a lot of countries have built them, so any@@ body who's done a fast re@@ ac@@ tor is a can@@ di@@ d@@ ate to be where the first one gets buil@@ t.
CA: So, in your min@@ d, tim@@ es@@ c@@ ale and lik@@ el@@ i@@ ho@@ od of actually taking something like this li@@ v@@ e?
B@@ G: Well, we need -- for one of these high@@ -@@ scal@@ e, elec@@ tro@@ -@@ gener@@ ation things that's very che@@ ap@@ , we have 20 years to inv@@ ent and then 20 years to de@@ plo@@ y.
That's sort of the de@@ ad@@ line that the environ@@ mental model@@ s have sho@@ wn us that we have to me@@ et.
And, you know, T@@ er@@ ra@@ Po@@ wer@@ , if things go well -- which is wis@@ h@@ ing for a lot -- could eas@@ ily me@@ et that.
And there are, fortun@@ ately now, do@@ z@@ ens of compan@@ ies -- we need it to be hundre@@ ds -- wh@@ o, lik@@ e@@ wis@@ e, if their science goes well, if the fund@@ ing for their p@@ ilo@@ t plan@@ ts goes well, that they can comp@@ ete for this.
And it's best if mul@@ ti@@ ple succ@@ e@@ ed, because then you could use a mi@@ x of these things.
We certain@@ ly need one to succ@@ e@@ ed.
CA: In terms of big@@ -@@ sc@@ ale possible game chan@@ ges@@ , is this the big@@ gest that you're a@@ ware of out ther@@ e?
B@@ G: An energy bre@@ ak@@ through is the most important thing.
It would have be@@ en, even without the environ@@ mental con@@ stra@@ in@@ t, but the environ@@ mental con@@ stra@@ in@@ t just makes it so much great@@ er.
In the nu@@ clear spac@@ e, there are other innov@@ ator@@ s.
You know, we don't know their work as well as we know this one, but the mod@@ ular people, that's a different appro@@ ach@@ .
There's a li@@ qu@@ id@@ -@@ ty@@ pe re@@ ac@@ tor@@ , which seems a little har@@ d, but maybe they say that about us.
And so, there are different on@@ es, but the beau@@ ty of this is a molec@@ ule of ur@@ an@@ i@@ um has a million times as much energy as a molec@@ ule of, say, co@@ al, and so -- if you can deal with the neg@@ ativ@@ es, which are essenti@@ ally the radi@@ ation -- the foo@@ t@@ prin@@ t and co@@ st, the potenti@@ al, in terms of eff@@ ect on land and vari@@ ous things, is almost in a clas@@ s of its ow@@ n.
CA: If this doesn't work, then what@@ ?
Do we have to start taking em@@ er@@ gen@@ c@@ y meas@@ ur@@ es to try and keep the tem@@ per@@ ature of the ear@@ th st@@ ab@@ le@@ ?
B@@ G: If you get into that s@@ itu@@ ation, it's like if you've been over@@ -@@ e@@ at@@ ing, and you're about to have a heart att@@ ack@@ : Then where do you go@@ ? You may need heart sur@@ ger@@ y or some@@ thing.
There is a line of research on what's called ge@@ o@@ engine@@ er@@ ing, which are vari@@ ous techn@@ i@@ qu@@ es that would del@@ ay the he@@ ating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act toge@@ ther.
Now, that's just an in@@ sur@@ ance po@@ lic@@ y.
You hope you don't need to do that.
Some people say you sh@@ ouldn't even work on the in@@ sur@@ ance po@@ lic@@ y because it might make you la@@ z@@ y, that you'll keep e@@ ating because you know heart sur@@ ger@@ y will be there to sa@@ ve you.
I'm not sure that's wis@@ e, given the import@@ ance of the problem@@ , but there's now the ge@@ o@@ engine@@ er@@ ing dis@@ c@@ us@@ sion about -- should that be in the back po@@ ck@@ et in case things happen fast@@ er, or this innov@@ ation goes a lot s@@ lo@@ wer than we exp@@ ec@@ t?
CA: C@@ lim@@ ate sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ s: If you had a s@@ ent@@ ence or two to say to them, how might you per@@ su@@ ade them that they're wr@@ ong@@ ?
B@@ G: Well, un@@ fortun@@ at@@ ely, the sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ s come in different c@@ amp@@ s.
The ones who make scienti@@ fic ar@@ gum@@ ents are very fe@@ w.
A@@ re they saying that there's neg@@ ative fe@@ ed@@ back effec@@ ts that have to do with cl@@ ou@@ ds that off@@ set thing@@ s?
There are very, very few things that they can even say there's a ch@@ ance in a million of those things.
The ma@@ in problem we have here, it's kind of like AID@@ S.
You make the m@@ ist@@ a@@ ke now, and you pay for it a lot lat@@ er.
And so, when you have all sor@@ ts of ur@@ gen@@ t problem@@ s, the idea of taking pa@@ in now that has to do with a ga@@ in later, and a some@@ what un@@ certain pa@@ in thing -- in fact, the I@@ P@@ C@@ C re@@ por@@ t, that's not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily the wor@@ st cas@@ e, and there are people in the r@@ ich world who look at I@@ P@@ C@@ C and say, "@@ OK, that isn't that big of a de@@ al@@ ."
The fact is it's that un@@ certain part that should move us to@@ wards this.
But my dre@@ am here is that, if you can make it econom@@ ic, and me@@ et the CO@@ 2 con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts, then the sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ s say, "@@ OK, I don't care that it doesn't put out CO@@ 2@@ , I kind of wis@@ h it did put out CO@@ 2@@ , but I gu@@ ess I'll acc@@ ept it because it's che@@ aper than what's come befor@@ e."
CA: And so, that would be your respon@@ se to the B@@ j@@ or@@ n L@@ om@@ bor@@ g ar@@ gum@@ ent, that basically if you spend all this energy trying to sol@@ ve the CO@@ 2 problem@@ , it's going to take away all your other go@@ als of trying to ri@@ d the world of po@@ ver@@ ty and mal@@ ari@@ a and so for@@ th, it's a stu@@ pi@@ d wa@@ ste of the Ear@@ th@@ 's resourc@@ es to put money to@@ wards that when there are better things we can do.
B@@ G: Well, the actu@@ al sp@@ end@@ ing on the R@@ &@@ amp@@ ;@@ D piece -- say the U.S. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now -- it's not that dr@@ am@@ ati@@ c@@ .
It sh@@ ouldn't take away from other things.
The thing you get into big money on, and this, reas@@ on@@ able people can dis@@ agre@@ e, is when you have something that's non-@@ economic and you're trying to f@@ und that -- that, to me, mo@@ st@@ ly is a wa@@ st@@ e.
Un@@ less you're very close and you're just fund@@ ing the lear@@ ning cur@@ ve and it's going to get very che@@ ap@@ , I believe we should try more things that have a potenti@@ al to be far less exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve.
If the tra@@ de@@ -@@ off you get into is, "@@ Let's make energy su@@ per exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve@@ ," then the r@@ ich can aff@@ ord that.
I mean, all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lif@@ est@@ y@@ le.
The dis@@ ast@@ er is for that two billi@@ on.
And even L@@ om@@ bor@@ g has chan@@ ge@@ d.
H@@ is sh@@ ti@@ ck now is, "@@ Why isn't the R@@ &@@ amp@@ ;@@ D getting more dis@@ c@@ us@@ se@@ d@@ ?"
He's st@@ ill@@ , because of his ear@@ li@@ er stuff@@ , still as@@ soci@@ ated with the sk@@ ep@@ tic c@@ amp@@ , but he's realized that's a pretty lon@@ ely c@@ amp@@ , and so, he's making the R@@ &@@ amp@@ ;@@ D poin@@ t.
And so there is a thre@@ ad of something that I think is appro@@ pri@@ ate.
The R@@ &@@ amp@@ ;@@ D piec@@ e, it's cra@@ z@@ y how little it's fun@@ de@@ d.
CA: Wel@@ l B@@ ill@@ , I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect I spe@@ ak on the beh@@ al@@ f of most people here to say I really hope your wis@@ h comes tru@@ e. Thank you so much.
B@@ G: Thank you.
I'd like to share with you a dis@@ co@@ very that I made a few months ago while writ@@ ing an ar@@ tic@@ le for It@@ ali@@ an Wi@@ re@@ d.
I always keep my thes@@ au@@ ru@@ s hand@@ y wh@@ en@@ ever I'm writ@@ ing any@@ thing, but I'd already fin@@ ish@@ ed ed@@ iting the piec@@ e, and I realized that I had never once in my life looked up the word "@@ dis@@ ab@@ le@@ d@@ " to see what I'd fin@@ d.
L@@ et me read you the entr@@ y.
"@@ Dis@@ ab@@ le@@ d, ad@@ jec@@ tiv@@ e: c@@ rip@@ pl@@ ed, hel@@ pl@@ ess, us@@ el@@ ess, w@@ re@@ ck@@ ed, st@@ all@@ ed, ma@@ im@@ ed, w@@ oun@@ de@@ d, m@@ ang@@ le@@ d, l@@ am@@ e, mu@@ ti@@ lat@@ ed, run@@ -@@ down, wor@@ n@@ -@@ out, we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed, im@@ po@@ ten@@ t, c@@ a@@ str@@ at@@ ed, par@@ aly@@ z@@ ed, han@@ dic@@ appe@@ d, sen@@ il@@ e, de@@ cre@@ p@@ it, la@@ id@@ -@@ up, don@@ e-@@ up, don@@ e-@@ for@@ , don@@ e-@@ in cr@@ ack@@ ed@@ -@@ up, coun@@ te@@ d-@@ out@@ ; see also h@@ ur@@ t, us@@ el@@ ess and we@@ ak@@ .
Ant@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ s, health@@ y, str@@ ong@@ , cap@@ ab@@ le@@ ."
I was read@@ ing this li@@ st out l@@ ou@@ d to a fri@@ end and at first was lau@@ gh@@ ing, it was so lu@@ dic@@ r@@ ou@@ s, but I'd just go@@ tten pas@@ t "@@ m@@ ang@@ le@@ d@@ ," and my vo@@ ice bro@@ k@@ e, and I had to stop and collec@@ t myself from the emo@@ tional sho@@ ck and imp@@ act that the ass@@ au@@ l@@ t from these wor@@ ds un@@ le@@ as@@ he@@ d.
You know, of course, this is my r@@ ag@@ ge@@ dy old thes@@ au@@ ru@@ s so I'm thinking this must be an an@@ ci@@ ent prin@@ t dat@@ e, right?
Bu@@ t, in fact, the prin@@ t d@@ ate was the early 198@@ 0@@ s, when I would have been starting pri@@ mar@@ y school and form@@ ing an under@@ standing of myself outside the family un@@ it and as rel@@ ated to the other kids and the world around me.
And, need@@ less to say, thank God I wasn't using a thes@@ au@@ ru@@ s back th@@ en.
I mean, from this entr@@ y, it would se@@ em that I was bor@@ n into a world that perc@@ ei@@ ved someone like me to have nothing positi@@ ve what@@ so@@ ever going for them, when in fact, today I'm cel@@ eb@@ r@@ ated for the opportun@@ ities and adv@@ ent@@ ur@@ es my life has proc@@ ure@@ d.
So, I im@@ medi@@ ately went to look up the 200@@ 9 on@@ line ed@@ iti@@ on, exp@@ ec@@ ting to find a re@@ vis@@ ion wor@@ th not@@ ing.
Here's the up@@ d@@ ated ver@@ sion of this entr@@ y.
Un@@ fortun@@ at@@ ely, it's not much bet@@ ter.
I find the last two wor@@ ds under "@@ Ne@@ ar Ant@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ s@@ ," partic@@ ular@@ ly un@@ s@@ et@@ tl@@ ing@@ : "@@ wh@@ ol@@ e@@ " and "@@ wh@@ ol@@ es@@ om@@ e."
So, it's not just about the wor@@ ds.
It's what we believe about people when we name them with these wor@@ ds.
It's about the valu@@ es behind the wor@@ ds, and how we construc@@ t those valu@@ es.
Our langu@@ age aff@@ ec@@ ts our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people.
In fact, many an@@ ci@@ ent so@@ c@@ ie@@ ti@@ es, inclu@@ ding the Gre@@ ek@@ s and the R@@ om@@ an@@ s, belie@@ ved that to ut@@ ter a cur@@ se ver@@ b@@ ally was so power@@ ful@@ , because to say the thing out l@@ ou@@ d brought it into exist@@ ence.
So, what real@@ ity do we want to call into exist@@ enc@@ e: a person who is li@@ mit@@ ed, or a person who's em@@ power@@ ed@@ ?
B@@ y cas@@ ually doing something as simple as nam@@ ing a person@@ , a chil@@ d, we might be put@@ ting li@@ ds and c@@ ast@@ ing sha@@ do@@ ws on their power@@ .
W@@ ouldn't we want to open do@@ ors for them in@@ ste@@ ad@@ ?
One such person who op@@ en@@ ed do@@ ors for me was my ch@@ ild@@ ho@@ od doc@@ tor at the A@@ .@@ I@@ . du@@ P@@ on@@ t Institu@@ te in W@@ il@@ m@@ ing@@ t@@ on, D@@ el@@ a@@ war@@ e.
H@@ is name was D@@ r. P@@ iz@@ z@@ u@@ ti@@ l@@ lo@@ , an It@@ ali@@ an Americ@@ an, who@@ se nam@@ e, app@@ ar@@ ent@@ ly, was too diffic@@ ult for most Americ@@ ans to pr@@ on@@ oun@@ ce, so he went by D@@ r. P@@ .
And D@@ r. P always wor@@ e really col@@ or@@ ful bo@@ w ties and had the very perf@@ ect dis@@ pos@@ ition to work with childr@@ en.
I lo@@ ved almost everything about my time spent at this ho@@ sp@@ it@@ al, with the exc@@ ep@@ tion of my physi@@ cal ther@@ ap@@ y s@@ es@@ sion@@ s.
I had to do what seem@@ ed like inn@@ um@@ er@@ able rep@@ et@@ iti@@ ons of ex@@ er@@ cis@@ es with these th@@ ic@@ k, el@@ ast@@ ic b@@ ands -- different col@@ or@@ s, you know -- to help build up my le@@ g mus@@ cl@@ es, and I hat@@ ed these b@@ ands more than anything -- I hat@@ ed them, had nam@@ es for them. I hat@@ ed them.
And, you know, I was already bar@@ g@@ ain@@ ing, as a five year-@@ old chil@@ d, with D@@ r. P to try to get out of doing these ex@@ er@@ cis@@ es, un@@ succ@@ ess@@ ful@@ ly, of cour@@ se.
And, one day, he came in to my s@@ es@@ sion -- ex@@ h@@ au@@ st@@ i@@ ve and un@@ for@@ gi@@ v@@ ing, these s@@ es@@ si@@ ons -- and he said to me, "@@ Wo@@ w. A@@ im@@ e@@ e, you are such a str@@ ong and powerful little gir@@ l, I think you're going to bre@@ ak one of those b@@ and@@ s.
When you do bre@@ ak it, I'm going to give you a hund@@ red bu@@ ck@@ s."
Now, of course, this was a simple plo@@ y on D@@ r. P@@ 's part to get me to do the ex@@ er@@ cis@@ es I didn't want to do before the pro@@ spec@@ t of being the rich@@ est fi@@ v@@ e-@@ year-@@ old in the second flo@@ or war@@ d, but what he effec@@ tiv@@ ely did for me was res@@ ha@@ pe an a@@ w@@ ful da@@ ily oc@@ curr@@ ence into a new and pro@@ mis@@ ing experience for me.
And I have to w@@ on@@ der today to what ex@@ t@@ ent his vis@@ ion and his dec@@ lar@@ ation of me as a str@@ ong and powerful little gir@@ l shap@@ ed my own view of myself as an in@@ her@@ ently str@@ ong@@ , powerful and ath@@ le@@ tic person well into the fut@@ ure.
This is an example of how ad@@ ul@@ ts in positi@@ ons of power can ign@@ ite the power of a chil@@ d.
Bu@@ t, in the pre@@ vi@@ ous inst@@ anc@@ es of those thes@@ au@@ ru@@ s ent@@ ri@@ es, our langu@@ age isn't allo@@ wing us to evol@@ ve into the real@@ ity that we would all wan@@ t, the possi@@ bili@@ ty of an individu@@ al to see them@@ selves as cap@@ able.
Our langu@@ age h@@ as@@ n't c@@ au@@ ght up with the chang@@ es in our societ@@ y, many of which have been brought about by technolog@@ y.
C@@ er@@ tain@@ ly, from a medic@@ al stand@@ poin@@ t, my leg@@ s, las@@ er sur@@ ger@@ y for vis@@ ion im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment, tit@@ an@@ i@@ um k@@ ne@@ es and hi@@ p re@@ plac@@ em@@ ents for ag@@ ing bo@@ dies that are allo@@ wing people to more fully eng@@ age with their abili@@ ti@@ es, and move be@@ y@@ ond the li@@ mit@@ s that nature has im@@ posed on them -- not to men@@ tion social net@@ working plat@@ form@@ s allow people to self-@@ iden@@ tif@@ y, to c@@ la@@ im their own des@@ c@@ rip@@ tions of them@@ sel@@ ves,
so they can go al@@ ign with global grou@@ ps of their own ch@@ oo@@ s@@ ing.
So, perhaps technology is re@@ ve@@ al@@ ing more clear@@ ly to us now what has always been a tru@@ th@@ : that everyone has something r@@ are and powerful to off@@ er our societ@@ y, and that the human ability to a@@ da@@ p@@ t is our great@@ est ass@@ et.
The human ability to a@@ da@@ p@@ t, it's an interesting thing, because people have contin@@ ually wanted to talk to me about over@@ coming ad@@ vers@@ ity, and I'm going to make an ad@@ mis@@ sion@@ : This p@@ hr@@ ase never s@@ at right with me, and I always felt un@@ eas@@ y trying to answer peopl@@ e's ques@@ tions about it, and I think I'm starting to figure out wh@@ y.
Im@@ p@@ lic@@ it in this p@@ hr@@ ase of "@@ over@@ coming ad@@ vers@@ it@@ y@@ " is the idea that succ@@ ess, or happin@@ ess, is about em@@ erg@@ ing on the other side of a chall@@ eng@@ ing experience un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed or un@@ mar@@ ked by the experi@@ ence, as if my succ@@ ess@@ es in life have come about from an ability to si@@ des@@ te@@ p or cir@@ c@@ um@@ n@@ av@@ ig@@ ate the pres@@ um@@ ed p@@ it@@ falls of a life with pro@@ s@@ the@@ tic@@ s, or what other people perc@@ ei@@ ve as my dis@@ abili@@ ty.
Bu@@ t, in fact, we are chan@@ ge@@ d. We are mark@@ ed, of course, by a chall@@ eng@@ e, whether physi@@ call@@ y, emo@@ tion@@ ally or bo@@ th.
And I'm going to sug@@ gest that this is a good thing.
A@@ d@@ vers@@ ity isn't an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le that we need to get around in order to res@@ um@@ e living our life.
It's part of our life.
And I tend to think of it like my sha@@ do@@ w.
Som@@ e@@ times I see a lot of it, sometimes there's very litt@@ le, but it's always with me.
And, certain@@ ly, I'm not trying to di@@ min@@ ish the imp@@ ac@@ t, the wei@@ gh@@ t, of a person@@ 's stru@@ g@@ gl@@ e.
There is ad@@ vers@@ ity and chall@@ enge in life, and it's all very real and rel@@ ative to every single person@@ , but the question isn't whether or not you're going to me@@ et ad@@ vers@@ ity, but how you're going to me@@ et it.
So, our responsi@@ bili@@ ty is not simply shi@@ el@@ ding those we care for from ad@@ vers@@ ity, but pre@@ par@@ ing them to me@@ et it well.
And we do a dis@@ ser@@ vice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equ@@ i@@ pped to a@@ da@@ p@@ t.
There's an important differ@@ ence and dist@@ inc@@ tion between the objec@@ tive medic@@ al fact of my being an amp@@ ut@@ e@@ e and the sub@@ jec@@ tive societ@@ al op@@ in@@ ion of whether or not I'm dis@@ ab@@ le@@ d.
And, tru@@ th@@ ful@@ ly, the only real and consi@@ st@@ ent dis@@ ability I've had to con@@ front is the world ever thinking that I could be descri@@ bed by those defin@@ iti@@ ons.
In our des@@ ire to prot@@ ect those we care about by gi@@ ving them the col@@ d, hard tr@@ ut@@ h about their medic@@ al pro@@ g@@ no@@ s@@ is, or, in@@ de@@ ed, a pro@@ g@@ no@@ s@@ is on the exp@@ ected qu@@ ality of their life, we have to make sure that we don't put the first bri@@ ck in a w@@ all that will actually dis@@ able some@@ one.
Per@@ ha@@ ps the exist@@ ing model of only looking at what is bro@@ ken in you and how do we fi@@ x it, ser@@ ves to be more dis@@ abl@@ ing to the individu@@ al than the pa@@ th@@ ology it@@ self.
B@@ y not tre@@ ating the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess of a person@@ , by not ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging their po@@ ten@@ c@@ y, we are cre@@ ating another ill on top of whatever natural stru@@ g@@ g@@ le they might ha@@ ve.
We are effec@@ tiv@@ ely gra@@ ding some@@ on@@ e's wor@@ th to our commun@@ ity.
So we need to see through the pa@@ th@@ ology and into the r@@ ange of human cap@@ abili@@ ty.
And, most import@@ ant@@ ly, there's a par@@ tn@@ er@@ ship between those perc@@ ei@@ ved de@@ f@@ ici@@ en@@ ci@@ es and our great@@ est cre@@ ative abili@@ ty.
So it's not about de@@ valu@@ ing, or neg@@ at@@ ing, these more trying times as something we want to av@@ o@@ id or s@@ we@@ ep under the ru@@ g, but instead to find those opportun@@ ities w@@ ra@@ pped in the ad@@ vers@@ ity.
So maybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much over@@ coming ad@@ vers@@ ity as it is op@@ en@@ ing our@@ selves up to it, em@@ br@@ ac@@ ing it, gra@@ p@@ pl@@ ing with it, to use a w@@ res@@ tl@@ ing ter@@ m, maybe even d@@ anc@@ ing with it.
And, per@@ ha@@ p@@ s, if we see ad@@ vers@@ ity as natur@@ al, consi@@ st@@ ent and us@@ ef@@ ul@@ , we're less bur@@ den@@ ed by the pres@@ ence of it.
This year we cel@@ eb@@ rate the 200@@ th bir@@ th@@ day of Char@@ les Dar@@ win@@ , and it was 1@@ 50 years ago, when writ@@ ing about evol@@ u@@ tion, that Dar@@ w@@ in ill@@ u@@ str@@ at@@ ed, I think, a tr@@ ut@@ h about the human charac@@ ter.
To par@@ ap@@ hr@@ as@@ e: It's not the stron@@ gest of the species that survi@@ ves, no@@ r is it the most intelligen@@ t that survi@@ ves@@ ; it is the one that is most a@@ da@@ p@@ t@@ able to chang@@ e.
Con@@ f@@ lic@@ t is the gen@@ es@@ is of cre@@ ation.
F@@ rom Dar@@ win@@ 's work, am@@ ong@@ st other@@ s, we can recogn@@ ize that the human ability to survi@@ ve and fl@@ our@@ ish is dri@@ ven by the stru@@ g@@ g@@ le of the human spir@@ it through conf@@ lic@@ t into transform@@ ation.
So, again, transform@@ ation, a@@ da@@ p@@ t@@ ation, is our great@@ est human sk@@ ill@@ .
And, per@@ ha@@ p@@ s, until we're tes@@ ted, we don't know what we're made of@@ .
Ma@@ ybe that's what ad@@ vers@@ ity gives us@@ : a sense of self, a sense of our own power@@ .
So, we can give our@@ selves a gi@@ ft.
We can re@@ -@@ imagine ad@@ vers@@ ity as something more than just t@@ ough tim@@ es.
Ma@@ ybe we can see it as chang@@ e.
A@@ d@@ vers@@ ity is just change that we ha@@ ven@@ 't a@@ da@@ p@@ ted our@@ selves to y@@ et.
I think the great@@ est ad@@ vers@@ ity that we've created for our@@ selves is this idea of nor@@ mal@@ c@@ y.
Now, who's nor@@ mal@@ ?
There's no norm@@ al.
There's com@@ mon@@ , there's ty@@ pic@@ al. There's no norm@@ al, and would you want to me@@ et that po@@ or, b@@ ei@@ ge person if they exist@@ ed@@ ?
I don't think so.
If we can change this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m from one of achie@@ ving nor@@ mal@@ c@@ y to one of possi@@ bili@@ ty -- or po@@ ten@@ c@@ y, to be even a little bit more d@@ anger@@ ous -- we can rel@@ eas@@ e the power of so many more childr@@ en, and inv@@ ite them to eng@@ age their r@@ are and valu@@ able abili@@ ties with the commun@@ ity.
An@@ th@@ rop@@ olog@@ ists tell us that the one thing we as hum@@ ans have always re@@ qu@@ i@@ red of our community mem@@ bers is to be of us@@ e, to be able to con@@ tri@@ but@@ e.
There's evi@@ dence that Ne@@ ander@@ th@@ als, 60@@ ,000 years ago, car@@ ri@@ ed their el@@ der@@ ly and those with seri@@ ous physi@@ cal in@@ j@@ ur@@ y, and perhaps it's because the life experience of survi@@ v@@ al of these people pro@@ ved of val@@ ue to the commun@@ ity.
They didn't view these people as bro@@ ken and us@@ el@@ ess@@ ; they were seen as r@@ are and valu@@ able.
A few years ago, I was in a food market in the to@@ wn where I gre@@ w up in that red z@@ one in nor@@ the@@ ast@@ ern P@@ enn@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ an@@ i@@ a, and I was standing over a bus@@ h@@ el of tom@@ at@@ o@@ es.
It was sum@@ mer@@ tim@@ e: I had sh@@ or@@ ts on.
I hear this gu@@ y, his vo@@ ice behind me say, "Well, if it isn't A@@ im@@ e@@ e M@@ ul@@ lin@@ s."
And I turn aroun@@ d, and it's this ol@@ der man@@ . I have no idea who he is.
And I said, "@@ I'm sor@@ r@@ y, si@@ r@@ , have we met@@ ? I don't remember me@@ eting you@@ ."
He said, "Well, you wouldn't remember me@@ eting me.
I mean, when we met I was del@@ i@@ ver@@ ing you from your mo@@ ther@@ 's wom@@ b@@ ."
Oh, that gu@@ y.
And, but of course, actually, it did cli@@ ck.
This man was D@@ r. K@@ e@@ an, a man that I had only known about through my mo@@ ther@@ 's stories of that day, bec@@ ause, of course, ty@@ pic@@ al fas@@ hi@@ on, I ar@@ ri@@ ved l@@ ate for my bir@@ th@@ day by two week@@ s.
And so my mo@@ ther@@ 's pr@@ en@@ at@@ al physi@@ ci@@ an had gone on v@@ ac@@ ation, so the man who del@@ i@@ ver@@ ed me was a compl@@ ete str@@ ang@@ er to my par@@ ents.
And, because I was bor@@ n without the fi@@ b@@ ul@@ a b@@ on@@ es, and had feet turned in, and a few to@@ es in this foo@@ t and a few to@@ es in that, he had to be the be@@ ar@@ er -- this str@@ ang@@ er had to be the be@@ ar@@ er of bad new@@ s.
He said to me, "I had to give this pro@@ g@@ no@@ s@@ is to your par@@ ents that you would never wal@@ k, and you would never have the kind of mo@@ bili@@ ty that other kids have or any kind of life of in@@ dep@@ en@@ den@@ ce, and you've been making li@@ ar out of me ever sin@@ c@@ e."
The extra@@ ordinary thing is that he said he had sa@@ ved new@@ sp@@ aper cli@@ pp@@ ings through@@ out my whole ch@@ ild@@ ho@@ o@@ d, whether w@@ inn@@ ing a second gra@@ de sp@@ ell@@ ing be@@ e, mar@@ ching with the G@@ ir@@ l S@@ cou@@ ts, you know, the H@@ allo@@ we@@ en par@@ ad@@ e, w@@ inn@@ ing my col@@ le@@ ge sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ shi@@ p, or any of my sp@@ or@@ ts vic@@ tor@@ ies, and he was using it, and in@@ te@@ gr@@ ating it into teach@@ ing res@@ id@@ ent stud@@ ents, m@@ ed students from H@@ ah@@ n@@ em@@ an@@ n Me@@ dic@@ al Sch@@ oo@@ l and Her@@ sh@@ ey Me@@ dic@@ al Sch@@ ool@@ .
And he called this part of the course the X F@@ ac@@ tor@@ , the potenti@@ al of the human will@@ .
N@@ o pro@@ g@@ no@@ s@@ is can ac@@ coun@@ t for how powerful this could be as a det@@ er@@ min@@ ant in the qu@@ ality of some@@ on@@ e's life.
And D@@ r. K@@ e@@ an went on to tell me, he said, "@@ In my experi@@ ence, un@@ less re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly told other@@ wis@@ e, and even if given a mo@@ dic@@ um of supp@@ or@@ t, if left to their own de@@ vic@@ es, a child will achie@@ v@@ e."
Se@@ e, D@@ r. K@@ e@@ an made that shi@@ ft in think@@ ing.
He under@@ st@@ ood that there's a differ@@ ence between the medic@@ al con@@ dition and what someone might do with it.
And there's been a shi@@ ft in my thinking over time, in that, if you had asked me at 15 years ol@@ d, if I would have tra@@ ded pro@@ s@@ the@@ tic@@ s for fl@@ es@@ h@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ b@@ one leg@@ s, I wouldn't have h@@ es@@ it@@ ated for a secon@@ d.
I as@@ pi@@ red to that kind of nor@@ mal@@ c@@ y back th@@ en.
But if you ask me today, I'm not so su@@ re.
And it's because of the experi@@ ences I've had with them, not in sp@@ ite of the experi@@ ences I've had with them.
And perhaps this shi@@ ft in me has happened because I've been ex@@ posed to more people who have op@@ en@@ ed do@@ ors for me than those who have put li@@ ds and c@@ ast sha@@ do@@ ws on me.
Se@@ e, all you really need is one person to show you the ep@@ i@@ ph@@ any of your own power@@ , and you're off@@ .
If you can hand somebody the key to their own power -- the human spir@@ it is so rec@@ ep@@ tive -- if you can do that and open a do@@ or for someone at a c@@ ru@@ cial mom@@ ent, you are educ@@ ating them in the best sen@@ se.
You're teach@@ ing them to open do@@ ors for them@@ sel@@ ves.
In fact, the ex@@ act mean@@ ing of the word "@@ educ@@ ate@@ " comes from the ro@@ o@@ t word "@@ educ@@ e."
It means "@@ to bring for@@ th what is wi@@ thin@@ , to bring out potenti@@ al@@ ."
So again, which potenti@@ al do we want to bring ou@@ t?
There was a case study done in 19@@ 60@@ s Brit@@ ain@@ , when they were moving from gr@@ am@@ ma@@ r school@@ s to comp@@ re@@ h@@ en@@ sive school@@ s.
It's called the stre@@ am@@ ing tri@@ als. We call it "@@ tr@@ ack@@ ing@@ " here in the Stat@@ es.
It's se@@ par@@ ating students from A, B@@ , C@@ , D and so on.
And the "@@ A stud@@ ent@@ s@@ " get the t@@ ough@@ er cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um, the best teach@@ ers, et@@ c@@ .
Well, they to@@ o@@ k, over a thre@@ e-@@ mon@@ th peri@@ o@@ d, D@@ -@@ level stud@@ ents, gave them A@@ '@@ s, told them they were "A@@ '@@ s@@ ," told them they were b@@ right, and at the end of this thre@@ e-@@ mon@@ th peri@@ o@@ d, they were per@@ form@@ ing at A@@ -@@ level@@ .
And, of course, the hear@@ t@@ bre@@ ak@@ ing, f@@ li@@ p side of this stud@@ y, is that they took the "@@ A stud@@ ent@@ s@@ " and told them they were "@@ D@@ '@@ s."
And that's what happened at the end of that thre@@ e-@@ mon@@ th peri@@ o@@ d.
Th@@ o@@ se who were still around in school@@ , bes@@ i@@ des the people who had dro@@ pped out.
A c@@ ru@@ cial part of this case study was that the teach@@ ers were du@@ p@@ ed to@@ o.
The teach@@ ers didn't know a s@@ wit@@ ch had been ma@@ de.
They were simply t@@ ol@@ d, "@@ These are the '@@ A@@ -@@ stud@@ ent@@ s@@ ,@@ ' these are the '@@ D@@ -@@ stud@@ ent@@ s@@ .@@ '@@ " And that's how they went about teach@@ ing them and tre@@ ating them.
So, I think that the only true dis@@ ability is a cr@@ us@@ h@@ ed spir@@ it, a spir@@ it that's been cr@@ us@@ h@@ ed doesn't have hop@@ e, it doesn't see beau@@ ty, it no longer has our natur@@ al, ch@@ ild@@ like cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity and our inn@@ ate ability to imag@@ ine.
If in@@ ste@@ ad, we can b@@ ol@@ ster a human spir@@ it to keep hop@@ e, to see beau@@ ty in them@@ selves and other@@ s, to be cu@@ ri@@ ous and imagin@@ ati@@ ve, then we are tr@@ ul@@ y using our power well.
When a spir@@ it has those qu@@ al@@ iti@@ es, we are able to create new real@@ ities and new ways of bein@@ g.
I'd like to leave you with a po@@ em by a four@@ te@@ en@@ th@@ -@@ centur@@ y Per@@ si@@ an po@@ et nam@@ ed H@@ af@@ i@@ z that my fri@@ end, J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es Dem@@ bo@@ is told me ab@@ out, and the po@@ em is called "The God Wh@@ o On@@ ly K@@ no@@ ws F@@ our W@@ ord@@ s@@ "@@ : "@@ E@@ very child has known Go@@ d, not the God of nam@@ es, not the God of don@@ '@@ ts, but the God who only kno@@ ws four wor@@ ds and ke@@ ep@@ s re@@ pe@@ ating them, say@@ ing, '@@ C@@ ome d@@ ance with me.
