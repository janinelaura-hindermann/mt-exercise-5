L@@ ast year I sho@@ wed these two sli@@ des so that de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate that the ar@@ c@@ tic ice cap@@ , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lo@@ wer 4@@ 8 stat@@ es, has s@@ hr@@ un@@ k by 40 perc@@ ent.
But this under@@ stat@@ es the seri@@ ous@@ ness of this particular problem because it doesn't show the th@@ ick@@ ness of the ic@@ e.
The ar@@ c@@ tic ice c@@ a@@ p is, in a sen@@ se, the be@@ ating heart of the global climate system.
It exp@@ ands in win@@ ter and con@@ trac@@ ts in sum@@ mer@@ .
The next sli@@ de I show you will be a ra@@ pi@@ d fast@@ -@@ for@@ ward of what's happened over the last 25 years.
The per@@ man@@ ent ice is mar@@ ked in re@@ d.
As you see, it exp@@ ands to the dar@@ k bl@@ ue -- that's the an@@ nu@@ al ice in w@@ inter@@ , and it con@@ trac@@ ts in sum@@ mer@@ .
The so@@ -@@ called per@@ man@@ ent ic@@ e, five years old or ol@@ der, you can see is almost like bloo@@ d, sp@@ ill@@ ing out of the body here.
In 25 years it's gone from this, to this.
This is a problem because the war@@ m@@ ing he@@ at@@ s up the fro@@ zen gro@@ und around the Ar@@ c@@ tic O@@ c@@ e@@ an, where there is a mas@@ sive amount of fro@@ zen carb@@ on wh@@ ich, when it th@@ a@@ w@@ s, is turned into me@@ th@@ an@@ e by m@@ icro@@ bes@@ .
C@@ om@@ par@@ ed to the tot@@ al amount of global war@@ m@@ ing poll@@ ution in the at@@ mosp@@ here, that amount could d@@ ou@@ ble if we c@@ ross this ti@@ pping poin@@ t.
Al@@ ready in some sh@@ allow l@@ ak@@ es in Al@@ as@@ k@@ a, me@@ th@@ an@@ e is activ@@ ely bu@@ b@@ bl@@ ing up out of the water.
Pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or K@@ at@@ ey Wal@@ ter from the Univers@@ ity of Al@@ as@@ k@@ a went out with another te@@ am to another sh@@ allow la@@ ke last w@@ inter@@ .
Video@@ : W@@ ho@@ a@@ ! A@@ l G@@ or@@ e: S@@ he's ok@@ a@@ y. The question is whether we will be.
And one reason is, this enor@@ m@@ ous he@@ at sin@@ k he@@ at@@ s up Gre@@ en@@ land from the nor@@ th.
This is an an@@ nu@@ al mel@@ ting ri@@ ver@@ .
But the vol@@ um@@ es are much lar@@ ger than ever@@ .
This is the K@@ anger@@ l@@ us@@ su@@ a@@ q Ri@@ ver in s@@ ou@@ th@@ w@@ est Gre@@ en@@ lan@@ d.
If you want to know how se@@ a level ris@@ es from land@@ -@@ bas@@ e ice mel@@ ting this is where it re@@ ach@@ es the se@@ a.
These flo@@ ws are increas@@ ing very ra@@ p@@ id@@ ly.
At the other end of the plan@@ et, Ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic@@ a the lar@@ gest mas@@ s of ice on the plan@@ et.
L@@ ast mon@@ th scienti@@ sts re@@ por@@ ted the entire contin@@ ent is now in neg@@ ative ice bal@@ anc@@ e.
And w@@ est Ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic@@ a cro@@ pped up on top some under@@ -@@ se@@ a is@@ land@@ s, is partic@@ ular@@ ly ra@@ pi@@ d in its mel@@ t@@ ing.
That's equ@@ al to 20 feet of se@@ a level@@ , as is Gre@@ en@@ lan@@ d.
In the H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ as, the third lar@@ gest mas@@ s of ic@@ e: at the top you see new l@@ ak@@ es, which a few years ago were gl@@ ac@@ ier@@ s.
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their dr@@ in@@ king water from that mel@@ ting flo@@ w.
In the An@@ d@@ es, this gl@@ ac@@ ier is the s@@ ource of dr@@ in@@ king water for this c@@ ity.
The flo@@ ws have increas@@ ed.
But when they go a@@ way, so does much of the dr@@ in@@ king water.
In C@@ aliforni@@ a there has been a 40 percent de@@ cl@@ ine in the S@@ ier@@ r@@ a s@@ no@@ w@@ p@@ ac@@ k.
This is h@@ it@@ ting the res@@ er@@ vo@@ ir@@ s.
And the predic@@ tions, as you've re@@ ad, are seri@@ ous.
This dr@@ ying around the world has le@@ ad to a dr@@ am@@ atic incre@@ ase in fir@@ es.
And the dis@@ ast@@ ers around the world have been increas@@ ing at an absolutely extra@@ ordinary and un@@ pre@@ c@@ ed@@ ented rat@@ e.
F@@ our times as many in the last 30 years as in the pre@@ vi@@ ous 7@@ 5@@ .
This is a completely un@@ su@@ stain@@ able pat@@ ter@@ n.
If you look at in the con@@ tex@@ t of history you can see what this is do@@ ing.
In the last five years we've ad@@ ded 7@@ 0 million t@@ ons of CO@@ 2 every 2@@ 4 hours -- 25 million t@@ ons every day to the oce@@ an@@ s.
Loo@@ k car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly at the area of the e@@ ast@@ ern P@@ ac@@ if@@ ic, from the Americ@@ as, ex@@ ten@@ ding w@@ est@@ war@@ d, and on ei@@ ther side of the Indi@@ an sub@@ contin@@ ent, where there is a ra@@ dic@@ al de@@ pl@@ e@@ tion of ox@@ y@@ gen in the oce@@ an@@ s.
The big@@ gest single c@@ ause of global war@@ m@@ ing, along with de@@ for@@ est@@ ation, which is 20 percent of it, is the bur@@ ning of f@@ os@@ si@@ l fu@@ el@@ s.
O@@ il is a problem@@ , and co@@ al is the most seri@@ ous problem.
The United St@@ ates is one of the two lar@@ gest em@@ it@@ ter@@ s, along with Chin@@ a.
And the pro@@ pos@@ al has been to build a lot more co@@ al pl@@ ant@@ s.
But we're beginning to see a se@@ a chang@@ e.
Here are the ones that have been can@@ cell@@ ed in the last few years with some gre@@ en al@@ tern@@ ati@@ ves pro@@ po@@ se@@ d.
Ho@@ we@@ ver there is a poli@@ tical b@@ att@@ le in our countr@@ y.
And the co@@ al industri@@ es and the oil industri@@ es spent a qu@@ ar@@ ter of a billion dollars in the last cal@@ en@@ da@@ r year pro@@ mo@@ ting cle@@ an co@@ al, which is an ox@@ y@@ mor@@ on.
That im@@ age re@@ min@@ ded me of some@@ thing.
A@@ ro@@ und Christ@@ mas@@ , in my home in T@@ enn@@ es@@ see, a billion g@@ all@@ ons of co@@ al s@@ lu@@ dge was sp@@ il@@ le@@ d.
You probably saw it on the new@@ s.
Th@@ is, all over the countr@@ y, is the second lar@@ gest wa@@ ste stre@@ am in Americ@@ a.
This happened around Christ@@ mas@@ .
One of the co@@ al industr@@ y's ad@@ s around Christ@@ m@@ as was this one.
Video@@ : ♪@@ ♫ F@@ ro@@ st@@ y the co@@ al man is a j@@ oll@@ y, happy s@@ oul@@ .

The fact is, co@@ al isn't di@@ r@@ ty.

Thank you very much.
L@@ ast year at TED I gave an in@@ tro@@ duc@@ tion to the L@@ H@@ C@@ .
And I pro@@ mis@@ ed to come back and give you an up@@ d@@ ate on how that mach@@ ine work@@ ed.
So this is it. And for those of you that wer@@ en't there, the L@@ H@@ C is the lar@@ gest scienti@@ fic experim@@ ent ever at@@ tem@@ p@@ ted -- 2@@ 7 k@@ ilom@@ et@@ ers in cir@@ c@@ um@@ fer@@ ence.
I@@ ts job is to re@@ create the con@@ diti@@ ons that were pres@@ ent less than a billi@@ on@@ th of a second after the universe be@@ gan@@ , up to 6@@ 00 million times a secon@@ d.
It's nothing if not am@@ b@@ iti@@ ous.
This is the mach@@ ine bel@@ ow Gen@@ ev@@ a.
We take the pic@@ tures of those min@@ i@@ -@@ Bi@@ g B@@ ang@@ s inside det@@ ec@@ tor@@ s.
This is the one I work on. It's called the A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S det@@ ec@@ tor -- 4@@ 4 met@@ ers wi@@ de, 2@@ 2 met@@ ers in di@@ am@@ et@@ er.
Sp@@ ec@@ t@@ ac@@ ular picture here of A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S under construc@@ tion so you can see the scal@@ e.
On the 10@@ th of S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber last year we turned the mach@@ ine on for the first time.
And this picture was taken by A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S.
It caus@@ ed imm@@ en@@ se cel@@ eb@@ r@@ ation in the control room@@ .
It's a picture of the first be@@ am partic@@ le going all the way around the L@@ H@@ C@@ , col@@ li@@ ding with a piece of the L@@ H@@ C del@@ i@@ ber@@ at@@ ely, and sho@@ wer@@ ing partic@@ les into the det@@ ec@@ tor@@ .
In other wor@@ ds, when we saw that picture on S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 10@@ th we knew the mach@@ ine work@@ ed, which is a great tri@@ um@@ ph@@ .
I don't know whether this got the big@@ gest che@@ er, or this, when someone went on@@ to Google and saw the front p@@ age was like that.
It means we made cul@@ tural imp@@ act as well as scienti@@ fic imp@@ ac@@ t.
Ab@@ out a we@@ ek lat@@ er we had a problem with the mach@@ ine, rel@@ ated actually to these b@@ its of wir@@ e here -- these g@@ old wir@@ es.
Th@@ o@@ se wir@@ es car@@ ry 1@@ 3 thous@@ and am@@ ps when the mach@@ ine is working in full power@@ .
Now the engine@@ ers am@@ ong@@ st you will look at them and say, "N@@ o they don@@ '@@ t. They're small wir@@ es@@ ."
They can do that because when they are very c@@ old they are what's called super@@ con@@ duc@@ ting wi@@ re.
So at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 de@@ gre@@ es, col@@ der than the space between the star@@ s, those wir@@ es can take that curr@@ ent.
In one of the jo@@ in@@ ts between over 9@@ ,000 mag@@ net@@ s in L@@ H@@ C@@ , there was a man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing de@@ f@@ ec@@ t.
So the wir@@ e he@@ ated up s@@ ligh@@ tl@@ y, and its 1@@ 3@@ ,000 am@@ ps sud@@ den@@ ly en@@ co@@ unter@@ ed electri@@ cal res@@ ist@@ anc@@ e.
This was the resul@@ t.
Now that's more imp@@ res@@ sive when you consi@@ der those mag@@ net@@ s wei@@ gh over 20 ton@@ s, and they mo@@ ved about a foo@@ t.
So we dam@@ ag@@ ed about 50 of the mag@@ net@@ s.
We had to take them out, which we di@@ d.
We re@@ con@@ dition@@ ed them all, fi@@ x@@ ed them.
They're all on their way back under@@ gro@@ und now.
B@@ y the end of Mar@@ ch the L@@ H@@ C will be in@@ t@@ act again.
We will s@@ wit@@ ch it on, and we exp@@ ect to take data in J@@ un@@ e or J@@ ul@@ y, and contin@@ ue with our qu@@ est to find out what the building blo@@ cks of the universe are.
Now of course, in a way those ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents r@@ ei@@ gn@@ ite the de@@ b@@ ate about the val@@ ue of science and engine@@ er@@ ing at the ed@@ ge. It's eas@@ y to re@@ fut@@ e.
I think that the fact that it's so diffic@@ ul@@ t, the fact that we're over@@ re@@ ach@@ ing, is the val@@ ue of things like the L@@ H@@ C@@ .
I will leave the fin@@ al word to an Englis@@ h scienti@@ st, H@@ um@@ ph@@ re@@ y D@@ av@@ y, wh@@ o, I s@@ us@@ pec@@ t, when de@@ f@@ end@@ ing his pro@@ te@@ ge@@ 's us@@ el@@ ess experim@@ ents -- his pro@@ te@@ ge was Mich@@ a@@ el F@@ ar@@ a@@ day -- said this, "@@ No@@ thing is so d@@ anger@@ ous to the progr@@ ess of the human mind than to ass@@ um@@ e that our vie@@ ws of science are ul@@ tim@@ ate, that there are no my@@ st@@ eri@@ es in nat@@ ure, that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are complet@@ e, and that there are no new worl@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er@@ ."
Thank you.
I want to start out by as@@ king you to think back to when you were a ki@@ d, pla@@ ying with blo@@ ck@@ s.
As you fig@@ u@@ red out how to re@@ ach out and gr@@ as@@ p, pic@@ k them up and move them aroun@@ d, you were actually lear@@ ning how to think and sol@@ ve problems by under@@ standing and man@@ i@@ pul@@ ating sp@@ ati@@ al relation@@ shi@@ p@@ s.
Sp@@ ati@@ al reas@@ on@@ ing is de@@ e@@ ply connec@@ ted to how we understand a lot of the world around us.
So, as a computer sci@@ ent@@ ist inspi@@ red by this u@@ ti@@ li@@ ty of our inter@@ ac@@ tions with physi@@ cal objec@@ ts -- along with my ad@@ vis@@ er P@@ at@@ ti@@ e, and my coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ator Je@@ ev@@ an K@@ al@@ an@@ i@@ th@@ i -- I started to w@@ on@@ der -- what if when we used a compu@@ ter, instead of having this one m@@ ouse cur@@ s@@ or that was a like a dig@@ ital fing@@ er@@ ti@@ p moving around a fl@@ at des@@ k@@ to@@ p, what if we could re@@ ach in with both hand@@ s and gr@@ as@@ p information physi@@ call@@ y,
ar@@ r@@ ang@@ ing it the way we wan@@ te@@ d?
This question was so comp@@ ell@@ ing that we decided to expl@@ ore the answer@@ , by building Si@@ ft@@ abl@@ es.
In a n@@ ut@@ sh@@ ell, a Si@@ ft@@ able is an inter@@ ac@@ tive computer the size of a co@@ ok@@ i@@ e.
They're able to be mo@@ ved around by h@@ and, they can sense each other@@ , they can sense their mo@@ tion, and they have a scre@@ en and a wir@@ el@@ ess radi@@ o.
Mo@@ st import@@ ant@@ ly, they're physic@@ al, so like the blo@@ ck@@ s, you can move them just by re@@ ach@@ ing out and gr@@ as@@ p@@ ing.
And Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les are an example of a new ec@@ o@@ system of tool@@ s for man@@ i@@ pul@@ ating dig@@ ital inform@@ ation.
And as these tool@@ s become more physic@@ al, more a@@ ware of their mo@@ tion, a@@ ware of each other@@ , and a@@ ware of the nu@@ ance of how we move them, we can start to expl@@ ore some new and fu@@ n inter@@ action st@@ y@@ l@@ es.
So, I'm going to start with some simple exampl@@ es.
This Si@@ ft@@ able is con@@ fig@@ u@@ red to show vide@@ o, and if I ti@@ l@@ t it in one direc@@ tion, it@@ 'll ro@@ ll the video this wa@@ y@@ ; if I ti@@ l@@ t it the other way it ro@@ ll@@ s it back@@ war@@ ds.
And these inter@@ ac@@ tive p@@ ort@@ ra@@ its are a@@ ware of each other.
So if I put them next to each other@@ , they get interes@@ ted.
If they get sur@@ ro@@ un@@ de@@ d, they no@@ tice that to@@ o, they might get a little flu@@ ster@@ ed.
And they can also sense their mo@@ tion and ti@@ l@@ t.
One of the interesting imp@@ lic@@ ations on inter@@ ac@@ tion, we started to real@@ iz@@ e, was that we could use every@@ day ges@@ tures on dat@@ a, like p@@ our@@ ing a col@@ or the way we might p@@ our a li@@ qu@@ i@@ d.
So in this cas@@ e, we've got three Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les con@@ fig@@ u@@ red to be pain@@ t bu@@ ck@@ ets and I can use them to p@@ our col@@ or into that centr@@ al one, where they get mi@@ x@@ ed.
If we o@@ vers@@ ho@@ o@@ t, we can p@@ our a little bit bac@@ k.
There are also some ne@@ at possi@@ bili@@ ties for educ@@ ation, like langu@@ age, mat@@ h and lo@@ gi@@ c gam@@ es where we want to give people the ability to try things qu@@ ic@@ kl@@ y, and view the resul@@ ts im@@ medi@@ at@@ el@@ y.
So here I'm -- This is a F@@ i@@ b@@ on@@ acc@@ i sequ@@ ence that I'm making with a simple equ@@ ation progr@@ am.
Here we have a word game that's kind of like a mas@@ h@@ -@@ up between S@@ cr@@ ab@@ ble and B@@ og@@ gl@@ e.
Bas@@ ic@@ ally, in every ro@@ und you get a r@@ and@@ om@@ ly ass@@ ign@@ ed let@@ ter on each Si@@ ft@@ able, and as you try to make wor@@ ds it ch@@ ec@@ ks against a dic@@ tion@@ ar@@ y.
Th@@ en, after about 30 secon@@ ds, it res@@ hu@@ ff@@ l@@ es, and you have a new set of let@@ ters and new possi@@ bili@@ ties to tr@@ y.
Thank you.
So these are some kids that came on a fiel@@ d tri@@ p to the Me@@ di@@ a L@@ ab@@ , and I man@@ ag@@ ed to get them to try it out, and sho@@ o@@ t a vide@@ o.
They really lo@@ ved it.
And, one of the interesting things about this kind of app@@ lic@@ ation is that you don't have to give people many in@@ struc@@ tions.
All you have to say is, "@@ Ma@@ ke wor@@ d@@ s@@ ," and they know exactly what to do.
So here's another few people trying it out.
That's our yo@@ ung@@ est bet@@ a tes@@ ter, down there on the right.
T@@ ur@@ ns out, all he wanted to do was to st@@ ack the Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les up.
So to him@@ , they were just blo@@ ck@@ s.
Now, this is an inter@@ ac@@ tive car@@ to@@ on app@@ lic@@ ation.
And we wanted to build a lear@@ ning to@@ ol for langu@@ age lear@@ ner@@ s.
And this is F@@ el@@ i@@ x@@ , actu@@ ally.
And he can bring new charac@@ ters into the sc@@ en@@ e, just by lif@@ ting the Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les off the t@@ able that have that charac@@ ter sho@@ wn on them.
Her@@ e, he's bring@@ ing the su@@ n out.
David M@@ er@@ ri@@ ll@@ : Now he's brought a trac@@ tor into the sc@@ en@@ e.
G@@ ood job@@ ! Ye@@ ah@@ !
D@@ M: So by sha@@ king the Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les and put@@ ting them next to each other he can make the charac@@ ters inter@@ act -- Video@@ : W@@ oo@@ f@@ !
D@@ M: inv@@ ent@@ ing his own n@@ ar@@ r@@ ati@@ ve.
D@@ M: It's an op@@ en-@@ ended stor@@ y, and he gets to deci@@ de how it un@@ fol@@ ds.
D@@ M: So, the last example I have time to show you today is a music sequ@@ enc@@ ing and live per@@ for@@ man@@ ce to@@ ol that we've built rec@@ ent@@ ly, in which Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les act as so@@ unds like lea@@ d, bas@@ s and dr@@ um@@ s.
E@@ ach of these has four different vari@@ ations, you get to ch@@ oo@@ se which one you want to us@@ e.
And you can in@@ jec@@ t these so@@ unds into a sequ@@ ence that you can ass@@ em@@ ble into the pat@@ tern that you wan@@ t.
And you in@@ jec@@ t it by just b@@ ump@@ ing up the sound Si@@ ft@@ able against a sequ@@ ence Si@@ ft@@ able.
There are effec@@ ts that you can control li@@ ve, like re@@ ver@@ b and fil@@ ter.
You at@@ ta@@ ch it to a particular sound and then ti@@ l@@ t to ad@@ just it.
And then, over@@ all effec@@ ts like tem@@ p@@ o and vol@@ um@@ e that ap@@ ply to the entire sequ@@ ence.
So let's have a loo@@ k.
Video@@ : D@@ M: We@@ 'll start by put@@ ting a le@@ ad into two sequ@@ ence Si@@ ft@@ abl@@ es, ar@@ r@@ ange them into a seri@@ es, ex@@ tend it, ad@@ d a little more lea@@ d.
Now I put a bas@@ s line in.
Video@@ : D@@ M: Now I'll put some perc@@ us@@ sion in.
Video@@ : D@@ M: And now I'll at@@ ta@@ ch the fil@@ ter to the dr@@ um@@ s, so I can control the eff@@ ect li@@ ve.
Video@@ : D@@ M: I can spe@@ ed up the whole sequ@@ ence by ti@@ l@@ ting the tem@@ p@@ o one way or the other.
Video@@ : D@@ M: And now I'll at@@ ta@@ ch the fil@@ ter to the bas@@ s for some more ex@@ pres@@ sion.
Video@@ : D@@ M: I can re@@ ar@@ r@@ ange the sequ@@ ence while it play@@ s.
So I don't have to pl@@ an it out in adv@@ ance, but I can impro@@ vis@@ e, making it longer or sh@@ or@@ ter as I go.
And now, fin@@ ally, I can fa@@ de the whole sequ@@ ence out using the vol@@ um@@ e Si@@ ft@@ able, ti@@ l@@ ted to the le@@ ft.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passi@@ on is for making new human@@ -@@ computer inter@@ fac@@ es that are a better mat@@ ch to the ways our bra@@ ins and bo@@ dies work.
And today, I had time to show you one point in this new design spac@@ e, and a few of the possi@@ bili@@ ties that we're working to bring out of the lab@@ or@@ ator@@ y.
So the thought I want to leave you with is that we're on the c@@ us@@ p of this new gener@@ ation of tool@@ s for inter@@ ac@@ ting with dig@@ ital medi@@ a that are going to bring information into our world on our ter@@ m@@ s.
Thank you very much.
I look for@@ ward to talking with all of you.
I am a writ@@ er.
W@@ rit@@ ing boo@@ ks is my pro@@ fes@@ sion but it's more than that, of cour@@ se.
It is also my great lif@@ el@@ ong love and fas@@ cin@@ ation.
And I don't exp@@ ect that that's ever going to chang@@ e.
Bu@@ t, that said, something kind of pec@@ u@@ li@@ ar has happened rec@@ ently in my life and in my car@@ e@@ er, which has caus@@ ed me to have to rec@@ ali@@ br@@ ate my whole relation@@ ship with this work.
And the pec@@ u@@ li@@ ar thing is that I rec@@ ently wrote this boo@@ k, this mem@@ o@@ ir called "@@ E@@ at, P@@ ra@@ y, Lo@@ ve@@ " wh@@ ich, deci@@ de@@ d@@ ly un@@ like any of my pre@@ vi@@ ous bo@@ ok@@ s, went out in the world for some reas@@ on, and became this big@@ , me@@ ga@@ -@@ sens@@ ation, intern@@ ational bes@@ ts@@ ell@@ er thing.
The res@@ ult of which is that every@@ where I go now, people tre@@ at me like I'm do@@ om@@ ed.
S@@ eri@@ ously -- do@@ om@@ ed, do@@ om@@ ed@@ !
L@@ ik@@ e, they come up to me now, all wor@@ ri@@ ed, and they say, "@@ Ar@@ en't you af@@ ra@@ id you're never going to be able to top that?
Ar@@ en't you af@@ ra@@ id you're going to keep writ@@ ing for your whole life and you're never ag@@ ain going to create a book that any@@ body in the world car@@ es about at all, ever again@@ ?"
So that's re@@ ass@@ ur@@ ing, you know.
But it would be wor@@ se, exc@@ ept for that I happen to remember that over 20 years ago, when I was a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er, when I first started tell@@ ing people that I wanted to be a writ@@ er, I was met with this same sort of f@@ ear@@ -@@ based re@@ ac@@ tion.
And people would say, "@@ Ar@@ en't you af@@ ra@@ id you're never going to have any succ@@ ess@@ ?
Ar@@ en't you af@@ ra@@ id the hum@@ ili@@ ation of re@@ jec@@ tion will k@@ ill you@@ ?
Ar@@ en't you af@@ ra@@ id that you're going to work your whole life at this c@@ raft and no@@ thing@@ 's ever going to come of it and you're going to die on a sc@@ ra@@ p he@@ a@@ p of bro@@ ken dre@@ ams with your m@@ outh f@@ ill@@ ed with bit@@ ter as@@ h of fail@@ ure@@ ?"
Li@@ ke that, you know.
The answer -- the sh@@ ort answer to all those ques@@ tions is, "@@ Y@@ es@@ ."
Y@@ es, I'm af@@ ra@@ id of all those things.
And I always have be@@ en.
And I'm af@@ ra@@ id of man@@ y, many more things bes@@ i@@ des that people can't even gu@@ ess at, like se@@ a@@ we@@ ed and other things that are sc@@ ar@@ y.
Bu@@ t, when it comes to writ@@ ing, the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lat@@ ely, and wonder@@ ing about lat@@ ely, is wh@@ y?
You know, is it r@@ ation@@ al@@ ?
Is it log@@ ical that any@@ body should be exp@@ ected to be af@@ ra@@ id of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do.
And what is it spec@@ if@@ ically about cre@@ ative v@@ ent@@ ur@@ es that seems to make us really ner@@ v@@ ous about each other@@ 's mental health in a way that other car@@ e@@ ers kind of don't do, you know@@ ?
Li@@ ke my da@@ d, for example, was a chem@@ ical engine@@ er and I don't rec@@ all once in his 40 years of chem@@ ical engine@@ er@@ ing any@@ body as@@ king him if he was af@@ ra@@ id to be a chem@@ ical engine@@ er, you know@@ ?
"@@ That chem@@ ic@@ al@@ -@@ engine@@ er@@ ing blo@@ ck, Joh@@ n, ho@@ w@@ 's it go@@ ing@@ ?"
It just didn't come up like that, you know@@ ?
But to be fa@@ ir@@ , chem@@ ical engine@@ ers as a group ha@@ ven@@ 't really ear@@ ned a re@@ put@@ ation over the cent@@ u@@ ri@@ es for being al@@ co@@ ho@@ li@@ c man@@ ic@@ -@@ de@@ pres@@ si@@ ves.
We writ@@ ers, we kind of do have that re@@ put@@ ation, and not just writ@@ ers, but cre@@ ative people across all gen@@ r@@ es, it seem@@ s, have this re@@ put@@ ation for being enor@@ m@@ ously ment@@ ally un@@ st@@ able.
And all you have to do is look at the very gri@@ m de@@ ath coun@@ t in the 20@@ th centur@@ y al@@ one, of really mag@@ n@@ ific@@ ent cre@@ ative min@@ ds who di@@ ed young and often at their own hand@@ s, you know@@ ?
And even the ones who didn't liter@@ ally com@@ mit su@@ ici@@ de se@@ em to be really und@@ one by their gi@@ ft@@ s, you know.
Nor@@ man Ma@@ il@@ er, just before he di@@ ed, last inter@@ vie@@ w, he said, "@@ E@@ very one of my boo@@ ks has kill@@ ed me a little mor@@ e."
An extra@@ ordinary stat@@ ement to make about your lif@@ e's work.
But we don't even bl@@ ink when we hear somebody say this, because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and som@@ eh@@ ow we've completely intern@@ al@@ ized and acc@@ ep@@ ted collec@@ tiv@@ ely this no@@ tion that cre@@ ativ@@ ity and su@@ ffer@@ ing are som@@ eh@@ ow in@@ her@@ ently lin@@ ked and that arti@@ str@@ y, in the end, will always ul@@ tim@@ ately le@@ ad to ang@@ u@@ ish@@ .
And the question that I want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all co@@ ol with that ide@@ a@@ ?
A@@ re you com@@ fort@@ able with that?
Because you look at it even from an in@@ ch away and, you know -- I'm not at all com@@ fort@@ able with that ass@@ ump@@ tion.
I think it's o@@ di@@ ous.
And I also think it's d@@ anger@@ ou@@ s, and I don't want to see it per@@ p@@ et@@ u@@ ated into the next centur@@ y.
I think it's better if we enc@@ our@@ age our great cre@@ ative min@@ ds to li@@ ve.
And I defin@@ it@@ ely know that, in my case -- in my s@@ ituation -- it would be very d@@ anger@@ ous for me to start sort of lea@@ king down that dar@@ k pat@@ h of ass@@ ump@@ tion, partic@@ ular@@ ly given the cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ ance that I'm in right now in my car@@ e@@ er.
Wh@@ ich is -- you know, like ch@@ ec@@ k it out, I'm pretty yo@@ ung@@ , I'm only about 40 years ol@@ d.
I still have maybe another four dec@@ a@@ des of work left in me.
And it's exc@@ e@@ ed@@ ing@@ ly lik@@ ely that anything I write from this point for@@ ward is going to be ju@@ d@@ g@@ ed by the world as the work that came after the fre@@ ak@@ ish succ@@ ess of my last boo@@ k, right?
I should just put it bl@@ un@@ tl@@ y, because we're all sort of fri@@ ends here now -- it's exc@@ e@@ ed@@ ing@@ ly lik@@ ely that my great@@ est succ@@ ess is behind me.
So J@@ es@@ us, what a though@@ t@@ !
That's the kind of thought that could le@@ ad a person to start dr@@ in@@ king g@@ in at n@@ ine o@@ '@@ clo@@ ck in the mor@@ n@@ ing, and I don't want to go there.
I would pre@@ fer to keep doing this work that I lo@@ ve.
And so, the question be@@ com@@ es, ho@@ w@@ ?
And so, it seems to me, up@@ on a lot of ref@@ lec@@ tion, that the way that I have to work now, in order to contin@@ ue writ@@ ing, is that I have to create some sort of prot@@ ec@@ tive psych@@ olog@@ ical construc@@ t, right?
I have to sort of find some way to have a sa@@ fe dist@@ ance between me, as I am writ@@ ing, and my very natural an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y about what the re@@ action to that writ@@ ing is going to be, from now on.
And, as I've been loo@@ k@@ ing, over the last year, for model@@ s for how to do that, I've been sort of looking across time, and I've been trying to find other so@@ c@@ ie@@ ties to see if they might have had better and s@@ an@@ er ideas than we have about how to help cre@@ ative people sort of man@@ age the in@@ her@@ ent emo@@ tional ris@@ ks of cre@@ ativ@@ ity.
And that se@@ ar@@ ch has led me to an@@ ci@@ ent Gre@@ ec@@ e and an@@ ci@@ ent R@@ om@@ e.
So sta@@ y with me, because it does cir@@ cle around and bac@@ k.
Bu@@ t, an@@ ci@@ ent Gre@@ ec@@ e and an@@ ci@@ ent R@@ ome -- people did not happen to believe that cre@@ ativ@@ ity came from human bein@@ gs back then, OK?
People belie@@ ved that cre@@ ativ@@ ity was this di@@ v@@ ine atten@@ d@@ ant spir@@ it that came to human bein@@ gs from some dist@@ ant and un@@ know@@ able s@@ ourc@@ e, for dist@@ ant and un@@ know@@ able reas@@ ons.
The Gre@@ ek@@ s fam@@ ously called these di@@ v@@ ine atten@@ d@@ ant spir@@ its of cre@@ ativ@@ ity "@@ da@@ em@@ on@@ s."
S@@ oc@@ rat@@ es, fam@@ ous@@ ly, belie@@ ved that he had a da@@ em@@ on who spo@@ ke wis@@ dom to him from af@@ ar@@ .
The R@@ om@@ ans had the same ide@@ a, but they called that sort of dis@@ em@@ bo@@ di@@ ed cre@@ ative spir@@ it a gen@@ i@@ us.
Wh@@ ich is gre@@ at, because the R@@ om@@ ans did not actually think that a gen@@ i@@ us was a partic@@ ular@@ ly cle@@ ver individu@@ al.
They belie@@ ved that a gen@@ i@@ us was this, sort of mag@@ ical di@@ v@@ ine ent@@ ity, who was belie@@ ved to liter@@ ally live in the w@@ all@@ s of an arti@@ st@@ 's studi@@ o, kind of like D@@ ob@@ by the h@@ ouse el@@ f, and sort of inv@@ isi@@ bly ass@@ ist the ar@@ t@@ ist with their work and would sha@@ pe the out@@ come of that work.
So bri@@ lli@@ ant -- there it is, right there, that dist@@ ance that I'm talking about -- that psych@@ olog@@ ical construc@@ t to prot@@ ect you from the resul@@ ts of your work.
And everyone knew that this is how it func@@ tion@@ ed, right?
So the an@@ ci@@ ent ar@@ t@@ ist was prot@@ ected from certain things, like, for example, too much n@@ ar@@ cis@@ s@@ is@@ m, right?
If your work was bri@@ lli@@ an@@ t, you couldn't take all the cre@@ di@@ t for it, everybody knew that you had this dis@@ em@@ bo@@ di@@ ed gen@@ i@@ us who had help@@ ed you.
If your work bom@@ be@@ d, not enti@@ r@@ ely your f@@ au@@ l@@ t, you know@@ ?
Every@@ one knew your gen@@ i@@ us was kind of l@@ am@@ e.
And this is how people thought about cre@@ ativ@@ ity in the W@@ est for a really long time.
And then the R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came and everything chan@@ ge@@ d, and we had this big ide@@ a, and the big idea was, let's put the individu@@ al human being at the cent@@ er of the universe abo@@ ve all go@@ ds and my@@ st@@ eri@@ es, and there's no more room for my@@ st@@ ical cre@@ atur@@ es who take dic@@ t@@ ation from the di@@ v@@ ine.
And it's the beginning of r@@ ational human@@ is@@ m, and people started to believe that cre@@ ativ@@ ity came completely from the self of the individu@@ al.
And for the first time in histor@@ y, you start to hear people re@@ fer@@ r@@ ing to this or that ar@@ t@@ ist as being a gen@@ i@@ us, rather than having a gen@@ i@@ us.
And I got to tell you, I think that was a huge err@@ or.
You know, I think that allo@@ wing som@@ ebo@@ d@@ y, one m@@ ere person to believe that he or she is like, the ves@@ sel@@ , you know, like the f@@ on@@ t and the ess@@ ence and the s@@ ource of all di@@ v@@ ine, cre@@ ati@@ ve, un@@ know@@ able, et@@ ern@@ al my@@ ster@@ y is just a sm@@ id@@ ge too much responsi@@ bili@@ ty to put on one frag@@ il@@ e, human psych@@ e.
It's like as@@ king somebody to s@@ w@@ allow the sun@@ .
It just completely war@@ ps and di@@ stor@@ ts e@@ go@@ s, and it cre@@ ates all these un@@ man@@ ag@@ e@@ able exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations about per@@ for@@ man@@ ce.
And I think the pres@@ sure of that has been kill@@ ing off our arti@@ sts for the last 500 years.
And, if this is tru@@ e, and I think it is tru@@ e, the question be@@ com@@ es, what no@@ w@@ ?
Can we do this differ@@ ent@@ l@@ y?
Ma@@ ybe go back to some more an@@ ci@@ ent under@@ standing about the relation@@ ship between hum@@ ans and the cre@@ ative my@@ ster@@ y.
Ma@@ ybe no@@ t.
Ma@@ ybe we can't just er@@ ase 500 years of r@@ ational human@@ ist@@ ic thought in one 18 min@@ ute spe@@ e@@ ch.
And there's probably people in this audi@@ ence who would ra@@ ise really leg@@ it@@ im@@ ate scienti@@ fic s@@ us@@ pic@@ i@@ ons about the no@@ tion of, bas@@ ic@@ ally, fa@@ i@@ ri@@ es who fol@@ low people around ru@@ b@@ b@@ ing fa@@ ir@@ y ju@@ ice on their projec@@ ts and stuff@@ .
I'm no@@ t, probab@@ ly, going to bring you all along with me on this.
But the question that I kind of want to pose is -- you know, why no@@ t?
Why not think about it this wa@@ y?
Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of expl@@ ain@@ ing the ut@@ ter ma@@ d@@ den@@ ing cap@@ ri@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness of the cre@@ ative proc@@ ess.
A process wh@@ ich, as any@@ body who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here -@@ -- kno@@ ws does not always beh@@ a@@ ve r@@ ation@@ ally.
And, in fact, can sometimes feel dow@@ n@@ right par@@ an@@ or@@ m@@ al.
I had this en@@ coun@@ ter rec@@ ently where I met the extra@@ ordinary American po@@ et R@@ ut@@ h St@@ one, who's now in her 9@@ 0@@ s, but sh@@ e's been a po@@ et her entire life and she told me that when she was gro@@ wing up in r@@ ur@@ al Vir@@ g@@ in@@ i@@ a, she would be out working in the fiel@@ ds, and she said she would feel and hear a po@@ em coming at her from over the land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e.
And she said it was like a th@@ under@@ ous tra@@ in of air@@ .
And it would come bar@@ rel@@ ing down at her over the land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e.
And she felt it com@@ ing, because it would sha@@ ke the ear@@ th under her fe@@ et.
She knew that she had only one thing to do at that poin@@ t, and that was to, in her wor@@ ds, "@@ run like h@@ ell@@ ."
And she would run like hel@@ l to the h@@ ouse and she would be getting ch@@ as@@ ed by this po@@ em@@ , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of p@@ aper and a pen@@ ci@@ l fast enough so that when it th@@ under@@ ed through her, she could collec@@ t it and gra@@ b it on the p@@ age.
And other times she wouldn't be fast en@@ ough@@ , so sh@@ e@@ 'd be run@@ ning and run@@ n@@ ing, and she wouldn't get to the h@@ ouse and the po@@ em would bar@@ re@@ l through her and she would mis@@ s it and she said it would contin@@ ue on across the land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e, loo@@ k@@ ing, as she put it "@@ for another po@@ et@@ ."
And then there were these times -- this is the piece I never for@@ got -- she said that there were mom@@ ents where she would almost mis@@ s it, right?
So, sh@@ e's run@@ ning to the h@@ ouse and sh@@ e's looking for the p@@ aper and the po@@ em pas@@ ses through her, and she gr@@ ab@@ s a pen@@ ci@@ l just as it's going through her, and then she said, it was like she would re@@ ach out with her other hand and she would cat@@ ch it.
She would cat@@ ch the po@@ em by its ta@@ il@@ , and she would pul@@ l it back@@ wards into her body as she was tran@@ sc@@ ri@@ b@@ ing on the p@@ age.
And in these inst@@ anc@@ es, the po@@ em would come up on the p@@ age perf@@ ect and in@@ t@@ act but back@@ war@@ ds, from the last word to the fir@@ st.
So when I heard that I was like -- that's un@@ c@@ ann@@ y, that's exactly what my cre@@ ative process is lik@@ e.
That's not at all what my cre@@ ative process is -- I'm not the pi@@ p@@ el@@ ine@@ !
I'm a mul@@ e, and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every day, and s@@ we@@ at and lab@@ or and bar@@ re@@ l through it really a@@ w@@ k@@ war@@ d@@ ly.
But even I@@ , in my mu@@ li@@ sh@@ n@@ ess, even I have br@@ us@@ h@@ ed up against that thing, at tim@@ es.
And I would imagine that a lot of you have to@@ o.
You know, even I have had work or ideas come through me from a s@@ ource that I hon@@ est@@ ly cannot iden@@ tif@@ y.
And what is that thing@@ ?
And how are we to rel@@ ate to it in a way that will not make us lose our min@@ ds, bu@@ t, in fact, might actually keep us s@@ an@@ e?
And for me, the best con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary example that I have of how to do that is the mus@@ ici@@ an T@@ om W@@ a@@ it@@ s, who I got to inter@@ view sever@@ al years ago on a mag@@ az@@ ine ass@@ ign@@ ment.
And we were talking about this, and you know, T@@ om@@ , for most of his life, he was pretty much the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the tor@@ ment@@ ed con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary mo@@ dern arti@@ st, trying to control and man@@ age and dom@@ in@@ ate these sort of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able cre@@ ative imp@@ ul@@ ses that were tot@@ ally intern@@ aliz@@ ed.
But then he got ol@@ der, he got cal@@ m@@ er, and one day he was dri@@ ving down the fre@@ e@@ way in L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es, and this is when it all chang@@ ed for him@@ .
And he's spe@@ ed@@ ing al@@ ong@@ , and all of a sud@@ den he hear@@ s this little frag@@ ment of mel@@ o@@ d@@ y, that comes into his head as in@@ spir@@ ation often com@@ es, el@@ usi@@ ve and tan@@ tal@@ iz@@ ing, and he wan@@ ts it, it's g@@ or@@ ge@@ ou@@ s, and he long@@ s for it, but he has no way to get it.
He doesn't have a piece of pa@@ per@@ , or a p@@ enc@@ il@@ , or a ta@@ pe rec@@ or@@ der.
So he star@@ ts to feel all of that old an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y start to rise in him like, "@@ I'm going to lose this thing, and I'll be be ha@@ un@@ ted by this son@@ g for@@ ever@@ .
I'm not good en@@ ough@@ , and I can't do it@@ ."
And instead of pan@@ ick@@ ing, he just st@@ op@@ pe@@ d.
He just sto@@ pped that whole mental process and he did something completely no@@ vel@@ .
He just looked up at the sk@@ y, and he said, "@@ Ex@@ c@@ use me, can you not see that I'm dri@@ v@@ ing@@ ?"
"@@ Do I look like I can write down a son@@ g right no@@ w@@ ?
If you really want to ex@@ ist, come back at a more opportun@@ e moment when I can take care of you.
O@@ ther@@ wis@@ e, go bo@@ ther somebody else today.
G@@ o bo@@ ther Le@@ on@@ ard C@@ oh@@ en@@ ."
And his whole work process chang@@ ed after that.
Not the work, the work was still of@@ ten@@ times as dar@@ k as ever@@ .
But the proc@@ ess, and the he@@ av@@ y an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y around it was rel@@ eas@@ ed when he took the gen@@ i@@ e, the gen@@ i@@ us out of him where it was caus@@ ing nothing but tr@@ ou@@ bl@@ e, and rel@@ eas@@ ed it back where it came fro@@ m, and realized that this didn't have to be this intern@@ aliz@@ ed, tor@@ ment@@ ed thing.
It could be this pec@@ u@@ li@@ ar, w@@ on@@ dr@@ ou@@ s, bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation, kind of con@@ vers@@ ation between T@@ om and the str@@ ang@@ e, ex@@ tern@@ al thing that was not quite T@@ om@@ .
When I heard that stor@@ y, it started to shi@@ ft a little bit the way that I worked to@@ o, and this idea already sa@@ ved me on@@ ce.
It sa@@ ved me when I was in the middle of writ@@ ing "@@ E@@ at, P@@ ra@@ y, Lo@@ ve@@ ," and I f@@ ell into one of those sort of p@@ its of des@@ pa@@ ir that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a dis@@ ast@@ er, the wor@@ st book ever writ@@ t@@ en.
Not just b@@ ad, but the wor@@ st book ever writ@@ t@@ en.
And I started to think I should just d@@ um@@ p this projec@@ t.
But then I remem@@ ber@@ ed T@@ om talking to the open air and I tried it.
So I just lif@@ ted my face up from the man@@ us@@ c@@ rip@@ t and I direc@@ ted my comm@@ ents to an emp@@ ty cor@@ ner of the room@@ .
And I said al@@ ou@@ d, "@@ L@@ ist@@ en you, thing, you and I both know that if this book isn't bri@@ lli@@ ant that is not enti@@ r@@ ely my f@@ au@@ l@@ t, right?
Because you can see that I am put@@ ting everything I have into this, I don't have any more than this.
If you want it to be bet@@ ter, you've got to show up and do your part of the de@@ al.
But if you don't do that, you know what@@ , the hel@@ l with it.
I'm going to keep writ@@ ing any@@ way because that's my job@@ .
And I would pleas@@ e like the rec@@ ord to ref@@ lec@@ t today that I sho@@ wed up for my part of the job@@ ."
Because -- Because in the end it's like this, O@@ K -- cent@@ u@@ ri@@ es ago in the des@@ er@@ ts of Nor@@ th Afric@@ a, people used to ga@@ ther for these mo@@ on@@ light d@@ anc@@ es of s@@ ac@@ red d@@ ance and music that would go on for hours and hour@@ s, until da@@ w@@ n.
They were always mag@@ n@@ ific@@ ent, because the d@@ anc@@ ers were pro@@ fes@@ sion@@ als and they were terri@@ f@@ ic, right?
But every once in a wh@@ il@@ e, very r@@ ar@@ ely, something would happ@@ en, and one of these per@@ for@@ mer@@ s would actually become tran@@ sc@@ en@@ den@@ t.
And I know you know what I'm talking ab@@ out, because I know you've all se@@ en, at some point in your life, a per@@ for@@ man@@ ce like this.
It was like time would st@@ op@@ , and the d@@ anc@@ er would sort of ste@@ p through some kind of p@@ ort@@ al and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever don@@ e, 1@@ ,000 nigh@@ ts befor@@ e, but everything would al@@ ign@@ .
And all of a sud@@ den, he would no longer appe@@ ar to be mer@@ ely hum@@ an.
He would be li@@ t from wi@@ thin@@ , and li@@ t from bel@@ ow and all li@@ t up on fir@@ e with di@@ v@@ in@@ ity.
And when this happen@@ ed, back then, people knew it for what it was, you know, they called it by its nam@@ e.
They would put their hand@@ s together and they would start to chan@@ t, "@@ Al@@ l@@ ah, Al@@ l@@ ah, Al@@ l@@ ah, Go@@ d, Go@@ d, Go@@ d@@ ."
That's Go@@ d, you know.
C@@ u@@ ri@@ ous histor@@ ical foo@@ t@@ no@@ te@@ : when the Mo@@ ors inv@@ ad@@ ed s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ pa@@ in, they took this cu@@ st@@ om with them and the pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation chang@@ ed over the cent@@ u@@ ri@@ es from "@@ Al@@ l@@ ah, Al@@ l@@ ah, Al@@ l@@ ah@@ ," to "@@ O@@ l@@ é@@ , ol@@ é@@ , ol@@ é@@ ," which you still hear in b@@ ull@@ f@@ igh@@ ts and in fl@@ am@@ enc@@ o d@@ anc@@ es.
In S@@ pa@@ in, when a per@@ form@@ er has done something im@@ possible and mag@@ ic, "@@ Al@@ l@@ ah, ol@@ é@@ , ol@@ é@@ , Al@@ l@@ ah, mag@@ n@@ ific@@ ent, bra@@ vo@@ ," in@@ comp@@ re@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ bl@@ e, there it is -- a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of Go@@ d.
Wh@@ ich is gre@@ at, because we need that.
Bu@@ t, the tri@@ ck@@ y bit comes the next mor@@ n@@ ing, for the d@@ anc@@ er him@@ self, when he wa@@ kes up and discover@@ s that it's T@@ u@@ es@@ day at 11 a@@ .@@ m@@ .@@ , and he's no longer a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of Go@@ d.
He's just an ag@@ ing mor@@ t@@ al with really bad k@@ ne@@ es, and maybe he's never going to as@@ c@@ end to that hei@@ ght again.
And maybe no@@ body will ever ch@@ ant Go@@ d@@ 's name ag@@ ain as he sp@@ in@@ s, and what is he then to do with the rest of his li@@ fe@@ ?
This is har@@ d.
This is one of the most pain@@ ful re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ations to make in a cre@@ ative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of ang@@ u@@ ish if you never happened to belie@@ ve, in the first plac@@ e, that the most extra@@ ordinary as@@ pec@@ ts of your being came from you.
But maybe if you just belie@@ ved that they were on lo@@ an to you from some un@@ imagin@@ able s@@ ource for some ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite por@@ tion of your life to be pas@@ sed along when you're fin@@ is@@ he@@ d, with somebody el@@ se.
And, you know, if we think about it this way, it star@@ ts to change every@@ thing.
This is how I've started to think, and this is certain@@ ly how I've been thinking in the last few months as I've been working on the book that will so@@ on be publi@@ sh@@ ed, as the d@@ anger@@ ous@@ ly, fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing@@ ly over@@ -@@ anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated fol@@ low up to my fre@@ ak@@ ish succ@@ ess.
And what I have to sort of keep tell@@ ing myself when I get really psych@@ ed out about that is don't be af@@ ra@@ i@@ d.
D@@ on't be da@@ un@@ ted. Just do your job@@ .
Con@@ tin@@ ue to show up for your piece of it, whatever that might be.
If your job is to d@@ ance, do your d@@ anc@@ e.
If the di@@ v@@ ine, co@@ ck@@ ey@@ ed gen@@ i@@ us ass@@ ign@@ ed to your case deci@@ des to let some sort of wonder@@ ment be g@@ lim@@ p@@ se@@ d, for just one moment through your eff@@ ort@@ s, then "@@ O@@ l@@ é@@ !"
And if no@@ t, do your d@@ ance any@@ ho@@ w.
And "@@ O@@ l@@ é@@ !" to you, n@@ on@@ eth@@ el@@ ess.
I believe this and I feel that we must te@@ ach it.
"@@ O@@ l@@ é@@ !" to you, n@@ on@@ eth@@ el@@ ess, just for having the sh@@ e@@ er human love and st@@ ub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness to keep sho@@ wing up.
Thank you.
Thank you.
J@@ un@@ e C@@ oh@@ en@@ : O@@ l@@ é@@ !
You know, I've talked about some of these projec@@ ts before -- about the human gen@@ ome and what that might mean, and discover@@ ing new s@@ ets of gen@@ es.
We're actually starting at a new poin@@ t: we've been dig@@ iti@@ z@@ ing biolog@@ y, and now we're trying to go from that dig@@ ital co@@ de into a new ph@@ ase of biolog@@ y with design@@ ing and syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ing life.
So, we've always been trying to ask big ques@@ tions.
"What is li@@ fe@@ ?" is something that I think many biolog@@ ists have been trying to understand at vari@@ ous level@@ s.
We've tried vari@@ ous appro@@ ach@@ es, par@@ ing it down to min@@ im@@ al comp@@ on@@ ents.
We've been dig@@ iti@@ z@@ ing it now for almost 20 year@@ s@@ ; when we sequ@@ enc@@ ed the human gen@@ om@@ e, it was going from the an@@ al@@ o@@ g world of biolog@@ y into the dig@@ ital world of the compu@@ ter.
Now we're trying to as@@ k, "@@ Can we re@@ gener@@ ate life or can we create new life out of this dig@@ ital uni@@ ver@@ se@@ ?"
This is the ma@@ p of a small organis@@ m, M@@ y@@ co@@ pl@@ as@@ ma gen@@ it@@ ali@@ um, that has the sm@@ all@@ est gen@@ ome for a species that can self-@@ rep@@ lic@@ ate in the lab@@ or@@ ator@@ y, and we've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even sm@@ aller gen@@ om@@ e.
We're able to kno@@ ck out on the order of 100 gen@@ es out of the 500 or so that are here.
When we look at its met@@ abo@@ li@@ c ma@@ p, it's rel@@ ativ@@ ely simple com@@ par@@ ed to our@@ s -- tr@@ ust me, this is simple -- but when we look at all the gen@@ es that we can kno@@ ck out one at a time, it's very un@@ lik@@ ely that this would y@@ iel@@ d a living cell@@ .
So we decided the only way for@@ ward was to actually syn@@ thes@@ ize this ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some so we could v@@ ary the comp@@ on@@ ents to ask some of these most fundament@@ al ques@@ tions.
And so we started down the ro@@ ad of@@ : can we syn@@ thes@@ ize a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some@@ ?
Can chem@@ ist@@ ry per@@ mit making these really large molec@@ ul@@ es where we've never been befor@@ e?
And if we do, can we boo@@ t up a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some@@ ?
A ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ e, by the way, is just a piece of in@@ ert chem@@ ical materi@@ al.
So, our p@@ ace of dig@@ iti@@ z@@ ing life has been increas@@ ing at an exp@@ on@@ enti@@ al p@@ ac@@ e.
Our ability to write the gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de has been moving pretty s@@ low@@ ly but has been increas@@ ing, and our lat@@ est point would put it on, now, an exp@@ on@@ enti@@ al cur@@ ve.
We started this over 15 years ago.
It took sever@@ al st@@ ag@@ es, in fact, starting with a bio@@ eth@@ ical re@@ view before we did the first experim@@ ents.
But it turns out syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ing DNA is very diffic@@ ul@@ t.
There are tens of thousands of mach@@ ines around the world that make small piec@@ es of DNA -- 30 to 50 let@@ ters in l@@ eng@@ th -- and it's a de@@ gener@@ ate proc@@ ess, so the longer you make the piec@@ e, the more err@@ ors there are.
So we had to create a new me@@ tho@@ d for put@@ ting these little piec@@ es together and cor@@ rec@@ t all the err@@ or@@ s.
And this was our first at@@ tem@@ p@@ t, starting with the dig@@ ital information of the gen@@ ome of ph@@ i X@@ 1@@ 7@@ 4@@ .
It's a small vi@@ ru@@ s that kill@@ s bacter@@ i@@ a.
We design@@ ed the piec@@ es, went through our er@@ ro@@ r cor@@ rec@@ tion and had a DNA molec@@ ule of about 5@@ ,000 let@@ ter@@ s.
The exc@@ iting ph@@ ase came when we took this piece of in@@ ert chem@@ ical and put it in the bacter@@ i@@ a, and the bacter@@ ia started to read this gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de, made the vir@@ al partic@@ l@@ es.
The vir@@ al partic@@ les then were rel@@ eas@@ ed from the cell@@ s and came back and kill@@ ed the E@@ . co@@ li@@ .
I was talking to the oil industr@@ y rec@@ ently and I said they clear@@ ly under@@ st@@ ood that model@@ .
They lau@@ gh@@ ed more than you guys are. And so, we think this is a s@@ ituation where the soft@@ ware can actually build its own har@@ d@@ ware in a biolog@@ ical system.
But we wanted to go much lar@@ ger@@ : we wanted to build the entire bacter@@ i@@ al ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some -- it's over 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,000 let@@ ters of gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de -- so we thought we@@ 'd build them in c@@ ass@@ et@@ tes the size of the vir@@ uses so we could actually v@@ ary the c@@ ass@@ et@@ tes to understand what the actu@@ al comp@@ on@@ ents of a living cell are.
D@@ es@@ ign is crit@@ ic@@ al, and if you're starting with dig@@ ital information in the compu@@ ter, that dig@@ ital information has to be really acc@@ ur@@ ate.
When we first sequ@@ enc@@ ed this gen@@ ome in 199@@ 5@@ , the stand@@ ard of acc@@ ur@@ ac@@ y was one er@@ ro@@ r per 10@@ ,000 bas@@ e pa@@ ir@@ s.
We actually f@@ oun@@ d, on res@@ equ@@ enc@@ ing it, 30 err@@ or@@ s@@ ; had we used that origin@@ al sequ@@ ence, it never would have been able to be boo@@ ted up.
Par@@ t of the design is design@@ ing piec@@ es that are 50 let@@ ters long that have to over@@ la@@ p with all the other 50@@ -@@ let@@ ter piec@@ es to build sm@@ aller sub@@ un@@ its we have to design so they can go toge@@ ther.
We design uni@@ qu@@ e el@@ em@@ ents into this.
You may have read that we put wat@@ er@@ mar@@ ks in.
Th@@ ink of this@@ : we have a four@@ -@@ let@@ ter gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de -- A, C@@ , G and T@@ .
T@@ ri@@ pl@@ ets of those let@@ ters co@@ de for r@@ ough@@ ly 20 am@@ in@@ o ac@@ id@@ s, such that there's a single let@@ ter design@@ ation for each of the am@@ in@@ o ac@@ id@@ s.
So we can use the gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de to write out wor@@ ds, s@@ ent@@ enc@@ es, though@@ ts.
In@@ iti@@ ally, all we did was au@@ to@@ gra@@ ph it.
Some people were dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted there was not po@@ etr@@ y.
We design@@ ed these piec@@ es so we can just che@@ w back with enz@@ y@@ mes@@ ; there are enz@@ y@@ m@@ es that re@@ pa@@ ir them and put them toge@@ ther.
And we started making piec@@ es, starting with piec@@ es that were 5@@ ,000 to 7@@ ,000 let@@ ter@@ s, put those together to make 2@@ 4@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ -@@ let@@ ter piec@@ es, then put s@@ ets of those going up to 7@@ 2@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ .
At each st@@ age, we gre@@ w up these piec@@ es in ab@@ und@@ ance so we could sequ@@ ence them because we're trying to create a process that's extre@@ m@@ ely ro@@ b@@ ust that you can see in a minut@@ e.
We're trying to get to the point of autom@@ ation.
So, this looks like a bas@@ k@@ et@@ b@@ all play@@ off@@ .
When we get into these really large piec@@ es over 100@@ ,000 bas@@ e pa@@ ir@@ s, they won't any longer grow re@@ a@@ di@@ ly in E@@ . col@@ i -- it ex@@ h@@ au@@ sts all the mo@@ dern tool@@ s of molec@@ ular biolog@@ y -- and so we turned to other mechan@@ is@@ m@@ s.
We knew there's a mechan@@ is@@ m called hom@@ olog@@ ous re@@ com@@ bin@@ ation that biolog@@ y uses to re@@ pa@@ ir DNA that can put piec@@ es toge@@ ther.
Here's an example of it@@ : there's an organis@@ m called D@@ ein@@ o@@ co@@ cc@@ us radi@@ o@@ dur@@ ans that can take three milli@@ ons ra@@ ds of radi@@ ation.
You can see in the top pan@@ el, its ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some just gets blo@@ wn ap@@ ar@@ t.
T@@ wel@@ ve to 2@@ 4 hours later, it put it back together exactly as it was befor@@ e.
We have thousands of organis@@ ms that can do this.
These organis@@ ms can be tot@@ ally des@@ ic@@ cat@@ ed@@ ; they can live in a v@@ ac@@ u@@ um.
I am absolutely certain that life can ex@@ ist in ou@@ ter spac@@ e, move aroun@@ d, find a new a@@ qu@@ e@@ ous environ@@ ment.
In fact, N@@ AS@@ A has sho@@ wn a lot of this is out there.
Here's an actu@@ al m@@ icro@@ gra@@ ph of the molec@@ ule we built using these proc@@ ess@@ es, actually just using ye@@ ast mechan@@ is@@ ms with the right design of the piec@@ es we put them in@@ ; ye@@ ast put@@ s them together autom@@ ati@@ call@@ y.
This is not an elec@@ tr@@ on m@@ icro@@ gra@@ ph@@ ; this is just a reg@@ ular pho@@ tom@@ icro@@ gra@@ ph@@ .
It's such a large molec@@ ule we can see it with a light m@@ ic@@ ros@@ cop@@ e.
These are pic@@ tures over about a si@@ x@@ -@@ second peri@@ o@@ d.
So, this is the pub@@ lic@@ ation we had just a sh@@ ort while ago.
This is over 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,000 let@@ ters of gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de@@ ; it's the lar@@ gest molec@@ ule ever made by hum@@ ans of a defin@@ ed struc@@ ture.
It's over 300 million molec@@ ular wei@@ gh@@ t.
If we prin@@ ted it out at a 10 f@@ on@@ t with no spac@@ ing, it takes 1@@ 4@@ 2 p@@ ages just to prin@@ t this gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de.
Well, how do we boo@@ t up a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some@@ ? How do we activ@@ ate this@@ ?
Ob@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly, with a vi@@ ru@@ s it's pretty simpl@@ e; it's much more comp@@ lic@@ ated de@@ al@@ ing with bacter@@ i@@ a.
It's also simpl@@ er when you go into eu@@ k@@ ar@@ yo@@ tes like our@@ sel@@ ves@@ : you can just po@@ p out the nu@@ cle@@ us and po@@ p in another one, and that's what you've all heard about with cl@@ on@@ ing.
W@@ ith bacter@@ ia and Ar@@ ch@@ a@@ e@@ a, the ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some is in@@ te@@ gr@@ ated into the c@@ ell, but we rec@@ ently sho@@ wed that we can do a compl@@ ete trans@@ pl@@ ant of a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some from one cell to another and activ@@ ate it.
We pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ ed a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some from one m@@ icro@@ bi@@ al species -- r@@ ough@@ ly, these two are as dist@@ ant as human and m@@ ice -- we ad@@ ded a few ex@@ tr@@ a gen@@ es so we could sel@@ ect for this ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ e, we di@@ ges@@ ted it with enz@@ y@@ m@@ es to k@@ ill all the prot@@ ein@@ s, and it was pretty st@@ un@@ ning when we put this in the cell -- and you'll app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate our very soph@@ ist@@ ic@@ ated gra@@ ph@@ ics here.
The new ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some went into the cell@@ .
In fact, we thought this might be as far as it wen@@ t, but we tried to design the process a little bit fur@@ ther.
This is a maj@@ or mechan@@ is@@ m of evolution right here.
We find all kinds of species that have taken up a second ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some or a third one from some@@ wher@@ e, ad@@ ding thousands of new tra@@ its in a second to that speci@@ es.
So, people who think of evolution as just one gen@@ e chang@@ ing at a time have mis@@ sed much of biolog@@ y.
There are enz@@ y@@ m@@ es called res@@ tri@@ c@@ tion enz@@ y@@ m@@ es that actually di@@ gest DN@@ A.
The ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some that was in the cell doesn't have on@@ e; the ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some we put in do@@ es.
It got ex@@ pres@@ sed and it recogn@@ ized the other ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some as for@@ eig@@ n materi@@ al, che@@ wed it up, and so we ended up just with a cell with the new ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ e.
It turned bl@@ ue because of the gen@@ es we put in it.
And with a very sh@@ ort peri@@ od of time, all the charac@@ ter@@ ist@@ ics of one species were lo@@ st and it con@@ ver@@ ted tot@@ ally into the new species based on the new soft@@ ware that we put in the cell@@ .
All the prot@@ ein@@ s chan@@ ge@@ d, the mem@@ br@@ an@@ es chan@@ ge@@ d@@ ; when we read the gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de, it's exactly what we had trans@@ fer@@ red in.
So, this may sound like gen@@ om@@ ic al@@ chem@@ y, but we c@@ an, by moving the soft@@ ware of DNA aroun@@ d, change things quite dr@@ am@@ ati@@ call@@ y.
Now I've ar@@ gu@@ ed, this is not gen@@ es@@ is@@ ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evol@@ u@@ tion.
And I've ar@@ gu@@ ed that we're about to perhaps create a new ver@@ sion of the C@@ am@@ bri@@ an expl@@ o@@ sion, where there's mas@@ sive new speci@@ ation based on this dig@@ ital design@@ .
Why do this@@ ?
I think this is pretty obvi@@ ous in terms of some of the need@@ s.
We're about to go from six and a half to n@@ ine billion people over the next 40 years.
To put it in con@@ tex@@ t for my@@ self@@ : I was bor@@ n in 19@@ 4@@ 6@@ .
There are now three people on the planet for every one of us that exist@@ ed in 19@@ 4@@ 6@@ ; within 40 years, there@@ 'll be four@@ .
We have tr@@ ou@@ ble fe@@ ed@@ ing, provi@@ ding f@@ res@@ h, cle@@ an wat@@ er, medic@@ in@@ es, fu@@ el for the six and a half billi@@ on.
It's going to be a stre@@ t@@ ch to do it for n@@ ine.
We use over five billion t@@ ons of co@@ al, 30 billi@@ on-@@ pl@@ us bar@@ rel@@ s of oil -- that's a hund@@ red million bar@@ rel@@ s a day.
When we try to think of biolog@@ ical proc@@ ess@@ es or any process to re@@ place that, it's going to be a huge chall@@ eng@@ e.
Then of course, there's all that CO@@ 2 from this materi@@ al that ends up in the at@@ mosp@@ here.
We now, from our dis@@ co@@ very around the world, have a dat@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 million gen@@ es, and I like to think of these as the design comp@@ on@@ ents of the fut@@ ure.
The elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ics industr@@ y only had a do@@ zen or so comp@@ on@@ ents, and look at the di@@ vers@@ ity that came out of that.
We're li@@ mit@@ ed here pri@@ mar@@ ily by a biolog@@ ical real@@ ity and our imagin@@ ation.
We now have techn@@ i@@ qu@@ es, because of these ra@@ pi@@ d me@@ tho@@ ds of syn@@ thes@@ is, to do what we're call@@ ing com@@ bin@@ at@@ ori@@ al gen@@ om@@ ic@@ s.
We have the ability now to build a large robo@@ t that can make a million ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es a day.
When you think of proc@@ ess@@ ing these 20 million different gen@@ es or trying to op@@ tim@@ ize proc@@ ess@@ es to produ@@ ce oc@@ tan@@ e or to produ@@ ce ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ eu@@ tic@@ als, new v@@ acc@@ in@@ es, we can just with a small te@@ am, do more molec@@ ular biolog@@ y than the last 20 years of all sci@@ ence.
And it's just stand@@ ard sel@@ ec@@ tion@@ : we can sel@@ ect for vi@@ abili@@ ty, chem@@ ical or fu@@ el produc@@ tion, v@@ acc@@ ine produc@@ tion, et@@ c@@ .
This is a scre@@ en s@@ n@@ ap@@ sho@@ t of some true design soft@@ ware that we're working on to actually be able to s@@ it down and design species in the compu@@ ter.
You know, we don't know nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily what it@@ 'll look lik@@ e: we know exactly what their gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de looks lik@@ e.
We're foc@@ using on now four@@ th@@ -@@ gener@@ ation fu@@ el@@ s.
You@@ 've seen rec@@ ent@@ ly, cor@@ n to eth@@ an@@ ol is just a bad experim@@ ent.
We have secon@@ d@@ - and thir@@ d-@@ gener@@ ation fu@@ el@@ s that will be coming out rel@@ ativ@@ ely so@@ on that are sug@@ ar, to much h@@ ig@@ her@@ -@@ val@@ ue fu@@ el@@ s like oc@@ tan@@ e or different typ@@ es of but@@ an@@ ol@@ .
But the only way we think that biolog@@ y can have a maj@@ or imp@@ act without fur@@ ther increas@@ ing the cost of food and li@@ mit@@ ing its av@@ ail@@ ability is if we start with CO@@ 2 as its fe@@ ed@@ sto@@ ck, and so we're working with design@@ ing cell@@ s to go down this ro@@ ad.
And we think we'll have the first four@@ th@@ -@@ gener@@ ation fu@@ el@@ s in about 18 month@@ s.
S@@ un@@ light and CO@@ 2 is one me@@ tho@@ d ...
but in our dis@@ co@@ very around the world, we have all kinds of other me@@ tho@@ ds.
This is an organis@@ m we descri@@ bed in 199@@ 6@@ .
It lives in the de@@ ep oce@@ an, about a m@@ ile and a half de@@ ep@@ , almost at bo@@ il@@ ing@@ -@@ water tem@@ per@@ atur@@ es.
It takes CO@@ 2 to me@@ th@@ an@@ e using molec@@ ular hy@@ dro@@ gen as its energy s@@ ourc@@ e.
We're looking to see if we can take cap@@ tu@@ red CO@@ 2@@ , which can eas@@ ily be pi@@ p@@ ed to sit@@ es, con@@ ver@@ t that CO@@ 2 back into fu@@ el to dri@@ ve this proc@@ ess.
So, in a sh@@ ort peri@@ od of time, we think that we might be able to incre@@ ase what the bas@@ ic question is of "What is li@@ fe@@ ?"
We tr@@ ul@@ y, you know, have mo@@ dest go@@ als of re@@ plac@@ ing the whole p@@ et@@ ro@@ l@@ -@@ chem@@ ical industr@@ y -- Ye@@ ah. If you can't do that at TED@@ , where can you@@ ? -- become a maj@@ or s@@ ource of energy ...
But also, we're now working on using these same tool@@ s to come up with inst@@ ant s@@ ets of v@@ acc@@ in@@ es.
You@@ 've seen this year with flu@@ ; we're always a year behind and a d@@ ollar sh@@ ort when it comes to the right v@@ acc@@ ine.
I think that can be chang@@ ed by building com@@ bin@@ at@@ ori@@ al v@@ acc@@ ines in adv@@ anc@@ e.
Here's what the future may beg@@ in to look like with chang@@ ing, now, the evol@@ ution@@ ary tre@@ e, spe@@ ed@@ ing up evolution with syn@@ the@@ tic bacter@@ i@@ a, Ar@@ ch@@ a@@ e@@ a and, ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally, eu@@ k@@ ar@@ yo@@ t@@ es.
We're a ways away from impro@@ ving peopl@@ e: our go@@ al is just to make sure that we have a ch@@ ance to survi@@ ve long enough to maybe do that. Thank you very much.
What I'm going to show you fir@@ st, as qu@@ ick@@ ly as I c@@ an, is some fo@@ und@@ ational work, some new technology that we brought to M@@ icro@@ so@@ ft as part of an ac@@ qu@@ is@@ ition almost exactly a year ago.
This is Se@@ ad@@ r@@ ag@@ on, and it's an environ@@ ment in which you can ei@@ ther lo@@ c@@ ally or re@@ mo@@ tel@@ y inter@@ act with v@@ ast amoun@@ ts of visu@@ al dat@@ a.
We're looking at man@@ y, many g@@ ig@@ ab@@ y@@ tes of dig@@ ital pho@@ to@@ s here and kind of se@@ am@@ l@@ ess@@ ly and contin@@ u@@ ously zo@@ om@@ ing in, p@@ ann@@ ing through it, re@@ ar@@ r@@ ang@@ ing it in any way we wan@@ t.
And it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at, how big these collec@@ tions are or how big the imag@@ es are.
Mo@@ st of them are ordinary dig@@ ital camer@@ a pho@@ to@@ s, but this one, for example, is a s@@ can from the Li@@ br@@ ary of Con@@ gr@@ ess, and it's in the 300 me@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el r@@ ang@@ e.
It doesn't make any differ@@ ence because the only thing that ought to li@@ mit the per@@ for@@ man@@ ce of a system like this one is the number of pi@@ x@@ el@@ s on your scre@@ en at any given mom@@ ent.
It's also very fle@@ x@@ i@@ ble architec@@ ture.
This is an entire boo@@ k, so this is an example of non-@@ im@@ age dat@@ a.
This is "@@ B@@ lea@@ k H@@ ou@@ se@@ " by D@@ ick@@ en@@ s. E@@ very col@@ um@@ n is a ch@@ ap@@ ter.
To pro@@ ve to you that it's really tex@@ t, and not an imag@@ e, we can do something like so, to really show that this is a real repres@@ ent@@ ation of the tex@@ t@@ ; it's not a pic@@ ture.
Ma@@ ybe this is an arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al way to read an e-@@ boo@@ k.
I wouldn't re@@ comm@@ end it.
This is a more real@@ ist@@ ic cas@@ e, an issu@@ e of The Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an.
E@@ very large im@@ age is the beginning of a sec@@ tion.
And this really gives you the jo@@ y and the good experience of read@@ ing the real p@@ aper ver@@ sion of a mag@@ az@@ ine or a new@@ sp@@ a@@ per@@ , which is an in@@ her@@ ently mul@@ ti@@ -@@ sc@@ ale kind of medi@@ um.
We've done something with the cor@@ ner of this particular issu@@ e of The Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an.
We've made up a fa@@ ke ad that's very high res@@ ol@@ ution -- much high@@ er than in an ordinary ad -- and we've em@@ be@@ d@@ ded ex@@ tr@@ a con@@ ten@@ t.
If you want to see the fe@@ atur@@ es of this car@@ , you can see it here.
Or other model@@ s, or even techn@@ ical spec@@ ific@@ ations.
And this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those li@@ mit@@ s on scre@@ en real est@@ ate.
We hope that this means no more po@@ p@@ -@@ up@@ s and other ru@@ b@@ b@@ is@@ h like that -- sh@@ ouldn't be nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ y.
O@@ f course, ma@@ pping is one of those obvi@@ ous app@@ lic@@ ations for a technology like this.
And this one I really won't spend any time on, exc@@ ept to say that we have things to con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te to this fiel@@ d as well.
But those are all the ro@@ ad@@ s in the U.S.
super@@ im@@ posed on top of a N@@ AS@@ A ge@@ o@@ sp@@ ati@@ al imag@@ e.
So let's pul@@ l up, now, something el@@ se.
This is actually live on the We@@ b no@@ w@@ ; you can go ch@@ ec@@ k it out.
This is a project called P@@ ho@@ to@@ syn@@ th, which mar@@ ri@@ es two different technologi@@ es.
One of them is Se@@ ad@@ r@@ ag@@ on and the other is some very beautiful compu@@ ter@@ -@@ vis@@ ion research done by No@@ ah S@@ na@@ vel@@ y, a gra@@ du@@ ate stud@@ ent at the Univers@@ ity of Was@@ hing@@ t@@ on, co@@ -@@ ad@@ vis@@ ed by Ste@@ ve S@@ ei@@ t@@ z at U.@@ W@@ .
and R@@ ick S@@ z@@ el@@ is@@ k@@ i at M@@ icro@@ so@@ ft Res@@ ear@@ ch. A very n@@ ice coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation.
And so this is live on the Web@@ . It's power@@ ed by Se@@ ad@@ r@@ ag@@ on.
You can see that when we do these sor@@ ts of vie@@ w@@ s, where we can di@@ ve through imag@@ es and have this kind of mul@@ ti@@ -@@ res@@ ol@@ ution experi@@ ence.
But the sp@@ ati@@ al ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ment of the imag@@ es here is actually mean@@ ing@@ ful@@ .
The computer vis@@ ion al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms have reg@@ ist@@ er@@ ed these imag@@ es together so that they cor@@ respon@@ d to the real space in which these sho@@ ts -- all taken ne@@ ar Gr@@ ass@@ i L@@ ak@@ es in the C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an Ro@@ ck@@ ies -- all these sho@@ ts were ta@@ k@@ en. So you see el@@ em@@ ents here of st@@ abili@@ z@@ ed sli@@ de@@ -@@ show or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic imag@@ ing, and these things have all been rel@@ ated sp@@ ati@@ ally.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you any other environ@@ ment@@ s.
Some are much more sp@@ ati@@ al.
I would like to j@@ um@@ p stra@@ ight to one of No@@ ah@@ 's origin@@ al dat@@ a-@@ s@@ ets -- this is from an early pro@@ to@@ ty@@ pe that we first got working this sum@@ mer -- to show you what I think is really the p@@ unch line behind the P@@ ho@@ to@@ syn@@ th technolog@@ y, It's not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily so app@@ ar@@ ent from looking at the environ@@ ments we've put up on the web@@ sit@@ e.
We had to wor@@ ry about the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers and so on.
This is a re@@ construc@@ tion of No@@ tr@@ e D@@ ame C@@ a@@ the@@ dr@@ al that was done enti@@ r@@ ely comp@@ ut@@ ation@@ ally from imag@@ es sc@@ ra@@ p@@ ed from F@@ li@@ ck@@ r.
You just ty@@ pe No@@ tr@@ e D@@ ame into F@@ li@@ ck@@ r@@ , and you get some pic@@ tures of guys in T@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ ts, and of the c@@ amp@@ us and so on.
And each of these or@@ ange con@@ es repres@@ ents an im@@ age that was discover@@ ed to bel@@ ong to this model@@ .
And so these are all F@@ li@@ ck@@ r imag@@ es, and they've all been rel@@ ated sp@@ ati@@ ally in this way.
We can just n@@ av@@ ig@@ ate in this very simple way.
You know, I never thought that I'd end up working at M@@ icro@@ so@@ ft.
It's very gr@@ ati@@ f@@ ying to have this kind of rec@@ ep@@ tion here.
I gu@@ ess you can see this is lots of different typ@@ es of camer@@ as@@ : it's everything from cell@@ -@@ phone camer@@ as to pro@@ fes@@ sion@@ al S@@ L@@ R@@ s, quite a large number of them, st@@ it@@ ched together in this environ@@ ment.
If I can find some of the sort of wei@@ r@@ d ones -- So many of them are oc@@ c@@ lu@@ ded by fac@@ es, and so on.
Som@@ e@@ where in here there is actually a ser@@ ies of photograph@@ s -- here we go.
This is actually a po@@ ster of No@@ tr@@ e D@@ ame that reg@@ ist@@ er@@ ed cor@@ rec@@ tl@@ y.
We can di@@ ve in from the po@@ ster to a physi@@ cal view of this environ@@ ment.
What the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environ@@ ment.
This is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collec@@ tive mem@@ or@@ y, visu@@ ally, of what the Earth looks like -- and lin@@ k all of that toge@@ ther.
Th@@ o@@ se pho@@ to@@ s become lin@@ k@@ ed, and they make something em@@ er@@ gen@@ t that's gre@@ ater than the s@@ um of the par@@ ts.
You have a model that em@@ erg@@ es of the entire Ear@@ th.
Th@@ ink of this as the long ta@@ il to Ste@@ ph@@ en La@@ w@@ l@@ er@@ 's Vir@@ tu@@ al Earth work.
And this is something that gro@@ ws in compl@@ ex@@ ity as people use it, and who@@ se ben@@ ef@@ its become gre@@ ater to the us@@ ers as they use it.
Th@@ ei@@ r own pho@@ to@@ s are getting t@@ ag@@ g@@ ed with met@@ a-@@ data that somebody else enter@@ ed.
If somebody bo@@ ther@@ ed to ta@@ g all of these sa@@ in@@ ts and say who they all are, then my pho@@ to of No@@ tr@@ e D@@ ame C@@ a@@ the@@ dr@@ al sud@@ den@@ ly gets en@@ rich@@ ed with all of that dat@@ a, and I can use it as an ent@@ ry point to di@@ ve into that spac@@ e, into that met@@ a-@@ vers@@ e, using everybody el@@ se@@ 's pho@@ to@@ s, and do a kind of a c@@ ros@@ s-@@ mod@@ al and c@@ ros@@ s-@@ us@@ er social experience that way.
And of course, a b@@ y-@@ produc@@ t of all of that is imm@@ en@@ sel@@ y r@@ ich virtu@@ al model@@ s of every interesting part of the Ear@@ th, collec@@ ted not just from over@@ head f@@ ligh@@ ts and from sat@@ elli@@ te imag@@ es and so on, but from the collec@@ tive mem@@ or@@ y.
Thank you so much.
Chris Ander@@ son@@ : Do I understand this right? What your soft@@ ware is going to allo@@ w, is that at some poin@@ t, really within the next few years, all the pic@@ tures that are shar@@ ed by any@@ one across the world are going to lin@@ k toge@@ ther@@ ?
B@@ A@@ A: Y@@ es. What this is really doing is discover@@ ing, cre@@ ating hy@@ per@@ lin@@ k@@ s, if you will, between imag@@ es.
It's doing that based on the cont@@ ent inside the imag@@ es.
And that gets really exc@@ iting when you think about the ri@@ ch@@ n@@ ess of the s@@ em@@ an@@ tic information a lot of imag@@ es ha@@ ve.
Li@@ ke when you do a we@@ b se@@ ar@@ ch for imag@@ es, you ty@@ pe in p@@ hr@@ as@@ es, and the tex@@ t on the we@@ b p@@ age is car@@ r@@ ying a lot of information about what that picture is of@@ .
What if that picture lin@@ ks to all of your pic@@ tur@@ es?
The amount of s@@ em@@ an@@ tic inter@@ connec@@ tion and ri@@ ch@@ n@@ ess that comes out of that is really hu@@ ge.
It's a clas@@ si@@ c net@@ work effec@@ t.
CA: Tr@@ ul@@ y incredi@@ ble. Con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ations.
You know, one of the inten@@ se pleas@@ ur@@ es of tra@@ vel and one of the del@@ igh@@ ts of eth@@ no@@ gra@@ phi@@ c research is the opportun@@ ity to live am@@ ong@@ st those who have not for@@ go@@ tten the old wa@@ ys, who still feel their pas@@ t in the win@@ d, tou@@ ch it in st@@ ones poli@@ sh@@ ed by ra@@ in, ta@@ ste it in the bit@@ ter lea@@ ves of pl@@ ant@@ s.
Just to know that J@@ ag@@ u@@ ar sh@@ am@@ ans still jour@@ ne@@ y be@@ y@@ ond the Mil@@ k@@ y W@@ a@@ y, or the my@@ th@@ s of the In@@ u@@ it el@@ ders still res@@ on@@ ate with mean@@ ing, or that in the H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ a, the Bu@@ dd@@ h@@ ist@@ s still pur@@ su@@ e the bre@@ ath of the D@@ har@@ ma@@ , is to really remember the centr@@ al re@@ vel@@ ation of an@@ th@@ rop@@ olog@@ y, and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not ex@@ ist in some absol@@ ute sen@@ se, but is just one model of real@@ ity,
the con@@ sequ@@ ence of one particular set of a@@ da@@ p@@ tive cho@@ ic@@ es that our lin@@ e@@ age ma@@ de, al@@ b@@ ei@@ t succ@@ ess@@ ful@@ ly, many gener@@ ations ago.
And of course, we all share the same a@@ da@@ p@@ tive im@@ per@@ ativ@@ es.
We're all bor@@ n. We all bring our children into the world.
We go through in@@ iti@@ ation rit@@ es.
We have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able se@@ par@@ ation of de@@ a@@ th, so it sh@@ ouldn't sur@@ pr@@ ise us that we all s@@ ing, we all d@@ ance, we all have ar@@ t.
But what's interesting is the uni@@ qu@@ e c@@ a@@ dence of the son@@ g, the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance in every cul@@ ture.
And whether it is the P@@ en@@ an in the for@@ es@@ ts of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o, or the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in Ha@@ iti@@ , or the war@@ ri@@ ors in the K@@ a@@ is@@ ut des@@ ert of Nor@@ ther@@ n Ken@@ y@@ a, the C@@ ur@@ ander@@ o in the moun@@ ta@@ ins of the An@@ d@@ es, or a car@@ av@@ an@@ ser@@ a@@ i in the middle of the S@@ ah@@ ar@@ a -- this is in@@ ci@@ dent@@ ally the fel@@ low that I tra@@ vel@@ ed into the des@@ ert with a mon@@ th ago -- or in@@ de@@ ed a y@@ ak her@@ der in the s@@ lo@@ p@@ es of Q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma@@ ,
E@@ ver@@ es@@ t, the go@@ d@@ des@@ s mother of the world.
All of these peopl@@ es te@@ ach us that there are other ways of bein@@ g, other ways of think@@ ing, other ways of ori@@ ent@@ ing your@@ self in the Ear@@ th.
And this is an ide@@ a, if you think about it, can only f@@ ill you with hop@@ e.
Now, together the my@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tures of the world make up a we@@ b of spir@@ itu@@ al life and cul@@ tural life that en@@ vel@@ op@@ s the plan@@ et, and is as important to the well@@ -@@ being of the planet as in@@ de@@ ed is the biolog@@ ical we@@ b of life that you know as a bio@@ sp@@ here.
And you might think of this cul@@ tural we@@ b of life as being an eth@@ no@@ sp@@ here, and you might defin@@ e the eth@@ no@@ sp@@ here as being the s@@ um tot@@ al of all though@@ ts and dre@@ am@@ s, my@@ th@@ s, ide@@ as, in@@ spir@@ ations, in@@ tu@@ iti@@ ons brought into being by the human imagin@@ ation since the da@@ wn of con@@ sci@@ ous@@ n@@ ess.
The eth@@ no@@ sp@@ here is human@@ it@@ y's great leg@@ ac@@ y.
It's the sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of all that we are and all that we can be as an ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing@@ ly in@@ qu@@ is@@ itive speci@@ es.
And just as the bio@@ sp@@ here has been sever@@ ely ero@@ de@@ d, so too is the eth@@ no@@ sp@@ here -- and, if any@@ thing, at a far gre@@ ater rat@@ e.
N@@ o biolog@@ ist@@ s, for example, would d@@ are sug@@ gest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ ink of ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion because it simply is not tru@@ e, and yet that -- the most a@@ po@@ c@@ aly@@ p@@ tic sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of biolog@@ ical di@@ vers@@ ity -- sc@@ ar@@ c@@ ely appro@@ ach@@ es what we know to be the most op@@ tim@@ ist@@ ic sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of cul@@ tural di@@ vers@@ ity.
And the great in@@ dic@@ ator of that, of course, is langu@@ age los@@ s.
When each of you in this room were bor@@ n, there were 6@@ ,000 langu@@ ages spo@@ ken on the plan@@ et.
Now, a langu@@ age is not just a body of v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary or a set of gr@@ amm@@ ati@@ cal rul@@ es.
A langu@@ age is a f@@ las@@ h of the human spir@@ it.
It's a v@@ eh@@ ic@@ le through which the s@@ ou@@ l of each particular cul@@ ture comes into the materi@@ al world.
E@@ very langu@@ age is an ol@@ d-@@ grow@@ th for@@ est of the min@@ d, a wat@@ er@@ sh@@ ed, a thought, an ec@@ o@@ system of spir@@ itu@@ al possi@@ bili@@ ti@@ es.
And of those 6@@ ,000 langu@@ ag@@ es, as we s@@ it here today in Mon@@ ter@@ e@@ y, fully half are no longer being wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the ear@@ s of childr@@ en.
They're no longer being tau@@ ght to bab@@ ies, which mean@@ s, effec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y, un@@ less something chan@@ ges@@ , they're already de@@ ad.
What could be more lon@@ ely than to be en@@ vel@@ op@@ ed in s@@ il@@ ence, to be the last of your people to spe@@ ak your langu@@ age, to have no way to pas@@ s on the wis@@ dom of the anc@@ est@@ ors or anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate the pro@@ mis@@ e of the childr@@ en?
And y@@ et, that dre@@ ad@@ ful f@@ ate is in@@ de@@ ed the p@@ light of somebody some@@ where on Earth r@@ ough@@ ly every two week@@ s, because every two week@@ s, some el@@ der dies and car@@ ri@@ es with him into the gra@@ ve the last sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ les of an an@@ ci@@ ent ton@@ gu@@ e.
And I know there's some of you who say, "Well, wouldn't it be bet@@ ter, wouldn't the world be a better place if we all just spo@@ ke one langu@@ ag@@ e@@ ?" And I say, "@@ Gre@@ at, let's make that langu@@ age Yor@@ ub@@ a. Let's make it C@@ ant@@ on@@ es@@ e.
Let's make it K@@ o@@ gi@@ ."
And you'll sud@@ den@@ ly dis@@ cover what it would be like to be un@@ able to spe@@ ak your own langu@@ age.
And so, what I'd like to do with you today is sort of take you on a jour@@ ne@@ y through the eth@@ no@@ sp@@ here, a b@@ rie@@ f jour@@ ne@@ y through the eth@@ no@@ sp@@ here, to try to beg@@ in to give you a sense of what in fact is being lo@@ st.
Now, there are many of us who sort of for@@ get that when I say "@@ different ways of bein@@ g@@ ," I really do mean different ways of bein@@ g.
T@@ ak@@ e, for example, this child of a Bar@@ as@@ an@@ a in the Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on, the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ da who believe that my@@ th@@ olog@@ ically they came up the mil@@ k ri@@ ver from the e@@ ast in the b@@ ell@@ y of s@@ ac@@ red s@@ n@@ ak@@ es.
Now, this is a people who cogn@@ iti@@ v@@ ely do not dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ish the col@@ or bl@@ ue from the col@@ or gre@@ en because the can@@ op@@ y of the he@@ av@@ ens is equ@@ ated to the can@@ op@@ y of the for@@ est up@@ on which the people dep@@ end.
They have a cu@@ ri@@ ous langu@@ age and mar@@ ri@@ age ru@@ le which is called "@@ l@@ ing@@ u@@ ist@@ ic ex@@ og@@ am@@ y@@ :@@ " you must mar@@ ry someone who spe@@ ak@@ s a different langu@@ age.
And this is all ro@@ o@@ ted in the my@@ th@@ olog@@ ical pa@@ st, yet the cu@@ ri@@ ous thing is in these long h@@ ous@@ es, where there are six or seven langu@@ ages spo@@ ken because of inter@@ mar@@ ri@@ age, you never hear any@@ one prac@@ tic@@ ing a langu@@ age.
They simply li@@ sten and then beg@@ in to spe@@ ak@@ .
Or@@ , one of the most fas@@ cin@@ ating tri@@ b@@ es I ever li@@ ved with@@ , the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i of nor@@ the@@ ast@@ ern E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or, an ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing people first cont@@ ac@@ ted pe@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly in 19@@ 5@@ 8@@ .
In 19@@ 5@@ 7@@ , five mis@@ sion@@ ar@@ ies at@@ tem@@ p@@ ted cont@@ act and made a crit@@ ical m@@ ist@@ ak@@ e.
They dro@@ pped from the air 8 x 10 g@@ los@@ s@@ y photograph@@ s of them@@ selves in what we would say to be friend@@ ly ges@@ tur@@ es, for@@ getting that these people of the ra@@ in@@ for@@ est had never seen anything t@@ wo@@ -@@ dimension@@ al in their li@@ ves.
They pic@@ ked up these photograph@@ s from the for@@ est flo@@ or, tried to look behind the face to find the form or the fig@@ ure, found no@@ thing, and conc@@ lu@@ ded that these were call@@ ing car@@ ds from the de@@ v@@ il@@ , so they sp@@ ear@@ ed the five mis@@ sion@@ ar@@ ies to de@@ a@@ th.
But the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i didn't just spe@@ ar out@@ si@@ der@@ s.
They sp@@ ear@@ ed each other.
5@@ 4 percent of their mor@@ tal@@ ity was du@@ e to them sp@@ ear@@ ing each other.
We trac@@ ed gen@@ e@@ al@@ o@@ gi@@ es back eight gener@@ ations, and we found two inst@@ anc@@ es of natural de@@ ath and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it, they ad@@ mit@@ ted that one of the fel@@ lo@@ ws had go@@ tten so old that he di@@ ed getting ol@@ d, so we sp@@ ear@@ ed him any@@ way. But at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ ac@@ i@@ ous knowle@@ dge of the for@@ est that was ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing.
Th@@ ei@@ r h@@ unter@@ s could sm@@ ell anim@@ al ur@@ ine at 40 p@@ ac@@ es and tell you what species left it beh@@ in@@ d.
In the early '@@ 8@@ 0@@ s, I had a really ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing ass@@ ign@@ ment when I was asked by my prof@@ ess@@ or at Har@@ v@@ ard if I was interested in going down to Ha@@ iti@@ , in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ating the sec@@ re@@ t so@@ c@@ ie@@ ties which were the fo@@ und@@ ation of D@@ u@@ val@@ ier@@ 's str@@ eng@@ th and T@@ on@@ ton M@@ ac@@ out@@ es, and sec@@ ur@@ ing the po@@ is@@ on used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es.
In order to make sense out of sens@@ ation, of course, I had to understand something about this re@@ mark@@ able fa@@ ith of V@@ o@@ do@@ un@@ . And V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is not a black mag@@ ic cul@@ t.
On the con@@ tr@@ ar@@ y, it's a compl@@ ex met@@ ap@@ h@@ y@@ si@@ cal world@@ vie@@ w.
It's interest@@ ing.
If I asked you to name the great religi@@ ons of the world, what would you sa@@ y?
Christ@@ i@@ an@@ ity, Isl@@ am, Bu@@ dd@@ h@@ is@@ m, Ju@@ da@@ is@@ m, what@@ ever@@ .
There's always one contin@@ ent left out, the ass@@ ump@@ tion being that sub@@ -S@@ ah@@ ar@@ an Africa had no religi@@ ous belie@@ f@@ s. Well, of course, they did and V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is simply the dist@@ ill@@ ation of these very pro@@ found religi@@ ous ideas that came over during the trag@@ ic Di@@ as@@ por@@ a of the s@@ la@@ very er@@ a.
Bu@@ t, what makes V@@ oo@@ do@@ o so interesting is that it's this living relation@@ ship between the living and the de@@ ad.
So, the living give bir@@ th to the spir@@ it@@ s.
The spir@@ its can be inv@@ o@@ ked from ben@@ e@@ ath the Gre@@ at W@@ at@@ er, respon@@ ding to the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance to mom@@ ent@@ ar@@ ily dis@@ place the s@@ ou@@ l of the li@@ v@@ ing, so that for that b@@ rie@@ f sh@@ in@@ ing mom@@ ent, the ac@@ ol@@ y@@ te be@@ comes the go@@ d.
That's why the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o@@ ists like to say that "@@ You wh@@ ite people go to ch@@ ur@@ ch and spe@@ ak about Go@@ d.
We d@@ ance in the tem@@ ple and become Go@@ d@@ ."
And because you are pos@@ s@@ es@@ se@@ d, you are taken by the spir@@ it -- how can you be har@@ me@@ d?
So you see these ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation@@ s: V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in a state of tr@@ ance hand@@ ling bur@@ ning em@@ bers with imp@@ un@@ ity, a rather ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation of the ability of the mind to aff@@ ect the body that be@@ ar@@ s it when cat@@ aly@@ z@@ ed in the state of extre@@ me exc@@ it@@ ation.
Now, of all the peopl@@ es that I've ever been with@@ , the most extra@@ ordinary are the K@@ og@@ i of the S@@ ier@@ r@@ a N@@ ev@@ ad@@ a de S@@ ant@@ a Mar@@ t@@ a in nor@@ ther@@ n Col@@ om@@ bi@@ a.
D@@ es@@ c@@ end@@ an@@ ts of the an@@ ci@@ ent Ta@@ ir@@ on@@ a civi@@ liz@@ ation which once car@@ p@@ et@@ ed the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in of Col@@ om@@ bi@@ a, in the wa@@ ke of the con@@ ques@@ t, these people re@@ tre@@ ated into an is@@ ol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic mas@@ si@@ f that so@@ ar@@ s abo@@ ve the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pl@@ ain@@ .
In a bloo@@ d@@ stain@@ ed contin@@ ent, these people al@@ one were never con@@ qu@@ er@@ ed by the Sp@@ an@@ ish@@ .
To this day, they re@@ ma@@ in rul@@ ed by a rit@@ ual pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood but the train@@ ing for the pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood is rather extra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ y.
The young ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes are taken away from their famili@@ es at the age of three and four@@ , se@@ ques@@ ter@@ ed in a sha@@ dow@@ y world of dar@@ kn@@ ess in st@@ one h@@ ut@@ s at the bas@@ e of gl@@ ac@@ ier@@ s for 18 year@@ s: two n@@ in@@ e-@@ year peri@@ o@@ ds del@@ i@@ ber@@ ately cho@@ s@@ en to m@@ im@@ ic the n@@ ine months of ges@@ t@@ ation they spend in their natural mo@@ ther@@ 's wom@@ b@@ ; now they are met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ically in the wom@@ b of the great mo@@ ther.
And for this entire time, they are in@@ cul@@ tur@@ ated into the valu@@ es of their societ@@ y, valu@@ es that ma@@ in@@ tain the pro@@ pos@@ ition that their pra@@ y@@ ers and their pra@@ y@@ ers al@@ one ma@@ in@@ tain the co@@ sm@@ ic -- or we might say the ec@@ olog@@ ical -- bal@@ anc@@ e.
And at the end of this amazing in@@ iti@@ ation, one day they're sud@@ den@@ ly taken out and for the first time in their li@@ ves, at the age of 18@@ , they see a sun@@ ris@@ e. And in that cr@@ y@@ st@@ al moment of a@@ war@@ en@@ ess of first light as the Su@@ n beg@@ ins to ba@@ the the s@@ lo@@ p@@ es of the st@@ un@@ n@@ ing@@ ly beautiful land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e, sud@@ den@@ ly everything they have learned in the ab@@ str@@ act is aff@@ ir@@ m@@ ed in st@@ un@@ ning gl@@ or@@ y. And the pri@@ est st@@ ep@@ s back
and says, "@@ You se@@ e? It's really as I've told you.
It is that beauti@@ ful@@ . It is your@@ s to prot@@ ec@@ t."
They call them@@ selves the "@@ el@@ der bro@@ ther@@ s@@ " and they say w@@ e, who are the yo@@ ung@@ er bro@@ ther@@ s, are the ones responsi@@ ble for des@@ tro@@ ying the world.
Now, this level of in@@ tu@@ ition be@@ comes very importan@@ t.
Wh@@ en@@ ever we think of indi@@ gen@@ ous people and land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e, we ei@@ ther inv@@ o@@ ke R@@ ous@@ se@@ a@@ u and the old can@@ ard of the "@@ no@@ ble sa@@ v@@ ag@@ e@@ ," which is an idea r@@ ac@@ ist in its sim@@ p@@ lic@@ ity, or al@@ tern@@ ati@@ vel@@ y, we inv@@ o@@ ke Th@@ or@@ e@@ a@@ u and say these people are clos@@ er to the Earth than we are.
Well, indi@@ gen@@ ous people are n@@ ei@@ ther sen@@ tim@@ ent@@ al no@@ r we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed by no@@ st@@ al@@ gi@@ a.
There's not a lot of room for ei@@ ther in the mal@@ ari@@ al s@@ w@@ am@@ ps of the A@@ sm@@ at or in the ch@@ ill@@ ing win@@ ds of Ti@@ bet@@ , but they ha@@ ve, ne@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ ess, through time and rit@@ u@@ al, for@@ g@@ ed a tradition@@ al my@@ st@@ i@@ qu@@ e of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ con@@ sci@@ ously close to it, but on a far sub@@ tl@@ er in@@ tu@@ iti@@ on@@ : the idea that the Earth it@@ self can only ex@@ ist because it is bre@@ ath@@ ed into being by human con@@ sci@@ ous@@ n@@ ess.
Now, what does that mean@@ ?
It means that a young ki@@ d from the An@@ des who's ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that that moun@@ tain is an A@@ p@@ u spir@@ it that will direc@@ t his or her des@@ tin@@ y will be a pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly different human being and have a different relation@@ ship to that res@@ ource or that place than a young ki@@ d from Mon@@ tan@@ a ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that a moun@@ tain is a p@@ ile of ro@@ ck ready to be min@@ ed.
W@@ he@@ ther it's the abo@@ de of a spir@@ it or a p@@ ile of ore is ir@@ rel@@ ev@@ an@@ t.
What's interesting is the met@@ ap@@ h@@ or that defin@@ es the relation@@ ship between the individu@@ al and the natural world.
I was ra@@ is@@ ed in the for@@ es@@ ts of Brit@@ ish Col@@ um@@ bi@@ a to believe those for@@ es@@ ts exist@@ ed to be cu@@ t.
That made me a different human being than my fri@@ ends am@@ ong@@ st the K@@ w@@ ag@@ i@@ ul@@ th who believe that those for@@ es@@ ts were the abo@@ de of H@@ u@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the C@@ ro@@ o@@ ked Be@@ ak of He@@ a@@ ven and the c@@ ann@@ i@@ b@@ al spir@@ its that d@@ well@@ ed at the nor@@ th end of the world, spir@@ its they would have to eng@@ age during their H@@ am@@ at@@ s@@ a in@@ iti@@ ation.
Now, if you beg@@ in to look at the idea that these cul@@ tures could create different real@@ iti@@ es, you could beg@@ in to understand some of their extra@@ ordinary discover@@ i@@ es. Ta@@ ke this pl@@ ant here.
It's a photogra@@ ph I took in the Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on just last A@@ pri@@ l@@ .
This is a@@ y@@ ah@@ u@@ as@@ c@@ a, which many of you have heard ab@@ out, the most powerful psych@@ o@@ ac@@ tive pre@@ par@@ ation of the sh@@ am@@ an@@ 's re@@ per@@ to@@ i@@ re.
What makes a@@ y@@ ah@@ u@@ as@@ c@@ a fas@@ cin@@ ating is not the sh@@ e@@ er ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ olog@@ ical potenti@@ al of this pre@@ par@@ ation, but the el@@ ab@@ or@@ ation of it. It's made really of two different s@@ ourc@@ es@@ : on the one h@@ and, this woo@@ dy li@@ an@@ a which has in it a ser@@ ies of bet@@ a-@@ carb@@ ol@@ in@@ es, har@@ min@@ e, har@@ mal@@ ine, m@@ ild@@ ly h@@ all@@ u@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic -- to take the v@@ ine al@@ one is rather to have sort of bl@@ ue ha@@ z@@ y s@@ mo@@ ke dri@@ ft across your con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness -- but it's mi@@ x@@ ed with the lea@@ ves of a s@@ hr@@ u@@ b in the co@@ ff@@ e@@ e family
called P@@ sy@@ ch@@ o@@ tri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ dis@@ .
This pl@@ ant had in it some very powerful tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ es, very close to brain ser@@ o@@ ton@@ in, di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ ine, 5@@ -@@ me@@ tho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ ine.
If you've ever seen the Y@@ an@@ om@@ am@@ i blo@@ wing that s@@ nu@@ f@@ f up their no@@ s@@ es, that sub@@ st@@ ance they make from a different set of species also con@@ ta@@ ins me@@ tho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ ine.
To have that po@@ w@@ der blo@@ wn up your no@@ se is rather like being sho@@ t out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ re@@ l lin@@ ed with bar@@ o@@ qu@@ e pain@@ t@@ ings and land@@ ing on a se@@ a of electri@@ c@@ ity. It doesn't create the di@@ stor@@ tion of real@@ it@@ y@@ ; it cre@@ ates the dis@@ sol@@ ution of real@@ ity.
In fact, I used to ar@@ gu@@ e with my prof@@ ess@@ or, Rich@@ ard E@@ v@@ an Sh@@ ul@@ tes -- who is a man who spar@@ ked the psych@@ ed@@ el@@ ic er@@ a with his dis@@ co@@ very of the mag@@ ic mus@@ h@@ room@@ s in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o in the 19@@ 30@@ s -- I used to ar@@ gu@@ e that you couldn't clas@@ si@@ f@@ y these tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ ines as h@@ all@@ u@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic because by the time you're under the effec@@ ts there's no one home any@@ more to experience a h@@ all@@ u@@ cin@@ ation. But the thing about tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ ines is they cannot be taken or@@ ally
because they're den@@ at@@ u@@ red by an enz@@ y@@ me found natur@@ ally in the human g@@ ut called mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine ox@@ i@@ d@@ as@@ e.
They can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion with some other chem@@ ical that den@@ atur@@ es the M@@ A@@ O@@ .
Now, the fas@@ cin@@ ating things are that the bet@@ a-@@ carb@@ ol@@ ines found within that li@@ an@@ a are M@@ A@@ O in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of the pre@@ c@@ ise sort nec@@ ess@@ ary to potenti@@ ate the tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ ine. So you ask your@@ self a ques@@ tion.
Ho@@ w, in a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0@@ ,000 species of v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar pl@@ ant@@ s, do these people find these two mor@@ ph@@ olog@@ ically un@@ rel@@ ated plan@@ ts that when com@@ bin@@ ed in this way, created a kind of bio@@ chem@@ ical ver@@ sion of the whole being gre@@ ater than the s@@ um of the par@@ ts@@ ?
Well, we use that great eu@@ ph@@ em@@ is@@ m, "@@ tri@@ al and err@@ or@@ ," which is ex@@ posed to be mean@@ ing@@ l@@ ess.
But you ask the Indi@@ an@@ s, and they say, "The plan@@ ts talk to us@@ ."
Well, what does that mean@@ ?
This tri@@ be, the C@@ of@@ an, has 1@@ 7 v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties of a@@ y@@ ah@@ u@@ as@@ c@@ a, all of which they dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ish a great dist@@ ance in the for@@ es@@ t, all of which are re@@ fer@@ able to our ey@@ e as one speci@@ es.
And then you ask them how they est@@ ab@@ lis@@ h their ta@@ x@@ on@@ om@@ y and they say, "I thought you knew something about pl@@ ant@@ s.
I mean, don't you know any@@ thing@@ ?" And I said, "@@ No@@ ."
Well, it turns out you take each of the 1@@ 7 v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties in the n@@ ight of a full mo@@ on, and it sing@@ s to you in a different ke@@ y.
Now, that's not going to get you a Ph@@ .@@ D@@ . at Har@@ v@@ ar@@ d, but it's a lot more interesting than coun@@ ting st@@ am@@ en@@ s. Now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sy@@ m@@ pa@@ the@@ tic with the p@@ light of indi@@ gen@@ ous people view them as qu@@ ain@@ t and col@@ or@@ ful but som@@ eh@@ ow re@@ duc@@ ed to the mar@@ g@@ ins of history as the real world, mean@@ ing our world, mo@@ ves on.
Well, the tr@@ ut@@ h is the 20@@ th centur@@ y, 300 years from now, is not going to be remem@@ ber@@ ed for its war@@ s or its technolog@@ ical innov@@ ations, but rather as the er@@ a in which we st@@ ood by the mas@@ sive des@@ tru@@ c@@ tion of both biolog@@ ical and cul@@ tural di@@ vers@@ ity on the plan@@ et. Now, the problem isn't chang@@ e.
All cul@@ tures through all time have con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly been eng@@ ag@@ ed in a d@@ ance with new possi@@ bili@@ ties of life.
And the problem is not technology it@@ self.
The Si@@ ou@@ x Indi@@ ans did not stop being Si@@ ou@@ x when they gave up the bo@@ w and ar@@ row any more than an American sto@@ pped being an American when he gave up the hor@@ se and bu@@ g@@ g@@ y.
It's not change or technology that thre@@ at@@ ens the in@@ te@@ gr@@ ity of the eth@@ no@@ sp@@ here. It is power@@ , the c@@ ru@@ de face of dom@@ in@@ ation.
W@@ her@@ ever you look around the world, you dis@@ cover that these are not cul@@ tures des@@ tin@@ ed to fa@@ de a@@ wa@@ y@@ ; these are dynam@@ ic living peopl@@ es being dri@@ ven out of exist@@ ence by iden@@ ti@@ fi@@ able forc@@ es that are be@@ y@@ ond their cap@@ ac@@ ity to a@@ da@@ p@@ t to@@ : whether it's the eg@@ regi@@ ous de@@ for@@ est@@ ation in the hom@@ el@@ and of the P@@ en@@ an -- a n@@ om@@ a@@ di@@ c people from S@@ ou@@ the@@ ast A@@ si@@ a, from S@@ ar@@ a@@ wa@@ k -- a people who li@@ ved free in the for@@ est until a gener@@ ation ago,
and now have all been re@@ duc@@ ed to serv@@ itu@@ de and pro@@ st@@ itu@@ tion on the ban@@ ks of the ri@@ ver@@ s, where you can see the ri@@ ver it@@ self is so@@ il@@ ed with the s@@ il@@ t that seems to be car@@ r@@ ying half of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o away to the South China Se@@ a, where the Jap@@ an@@ ese f@@ r@@ ei@@ gh@@ ters h@@ ang light in the hor@@ iz@@ on ready to f@@ ill their hol@@ ds with ra@@ w lo@@ gs ri@@ pped from the for@@ est -- or, in the case of the Y@@ an@@ om@@ am@@ i,
it's the diseas@@ e ent@@ ities that have come in, in the wa@@ ke of the dis@@ co@@ very of g@@ ol@@ d.
Or if we go into the moun@@ ta@@ ins of Ti@@ bet@@ , where I'm doing a lot of research rec@@ ent@@ ly, you'll see it's a c@@ ru@@ de face of poli@@ tical dom@@ in@@ ation.
You know, gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de, the physi@@ cal ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion of a people is univers@@ ally con@@ dem@@ ne@@ d, but eth@@ no@@ ci@@ de, the des@@ tru@@ c@@ tion of peopl@@ e's way of life, is not only not con@@ dem@@ ne@@ d, it's univers@@ ally, in many qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ s, cel@@ eb@@ r@@ ated as part of a develop@@ ment str@@ at@@ eg@@ y.
And you cannot understand the pa@@ in of Ti@@ be@@ t until you move through it at the gro@@ und level@@ .
I once tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ed 6@@ ,000 miles from Ch@@ eng@@ d@@ u in Wes@@ tern China over@@ land through s@@ ou@@ the@@ ast@@ ern Ti@@ be@@ t to L@@ h@@ as@@ a with a young col@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ e, and it was only when I got to L@@ h@@ as@@ a that I under@@ st@@ ood the face behind the st@@ atist@@ ics you hear ab@@ ou@@ t: 6@@ ,000 s@@ ac@@ red mon@@ um@@ ents tor@@ n ap@@ art to d@@ ust and ash@@ es, 1@@ .@@ 2 million people kill@@ ed by the c@@ ad@@ r@@ es during the C@@ ul@@ tural R@@ evol@@ u@@ tion.
This young man@@ 's fa@@ ther had been as@@ cri@@ bed to the P@@ an@@ ch@@ en L@@ am@@ a.
That me@@ ant he was inst@@ ant@@ ly kill@@ ed at the time of the Chin@@ ese inv@@ as@@ i@@ on.
H@@ is un@@ cle fl@@ ed with H@@ is H@@ ol@@ in@@ ess in the Di@@ as@@ por@@ a that took the people to N@@ ep@@ al.
H@@ is mother was in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated for the cri@@ me of being we@@ al@@ th@@ y.
He was s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed into the j@@ a@@ il at the age of two to hi@@ de ben@@ e@@ ath her sk@@ ir@@ t ta@@ il@@ s because she couldn't be@@ ar to be without him@@ .
The si@@ ster who had done that bra@@ ve de@@ ed was put into an educ@@ ation c@@ amp@@ .
One day she in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ently ste@@ pped on an ar@@ m@@ b@@ and of Ma@@ o, and for that trans@@ gr@@ es@@ sion, she was given seven years of hard lab@@ or.
The pa@@ in of Ti@@ be@@ t can be im@@ possible to be@@ ar, but the re@@ dem@@ p@@ tive spir@@ it of the people is something to beh@@ ol@@ d.
And in the end, then, it really comes down to a cho@@ ic@@ e: do we want to live in a mon@@ o@@ ch@@ ro@@ m@@ atic world of mon@@ o@@ ton@@ y or do we want to em@@ br@@ ace a pol@@ y@@ ch@@ ro@@ m@@ atic world of di@@ vers@@ it@@ y?
Mar@@ gar@@ et Me@@ ad, the great an@@ th@@ rop@@ olog@@ ist, said, before she di@@ ed, that her great@@ est fe@@ ar was that as we dri@@ f@@ ted to@@ wards this bl@@ and@@ ly am@@ or@@ ph@@ ous gener@@ ic world view not only would we see the entire r@@ ange of the human imagin@@ ation re@@ duc@@ ed to a more n@@ ar@@ row mod@@ ality of thought, but that we would wa@@ ke from a dre@@ am one day having for@@ go@@ tten there were even other possi@@ bili@@ ti@@ es.
And it's hum@@ bl@@ ing to remember that our species h@@ as, per@@ ha@@ p@@ s, been around for [@@ 1@@ 50@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ ] years.
The Ne@@ o@@ li@@ th@@ ic R@@ evolution -- which gave us ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ ture, at which time we succ@@ um@@ bed to the cul@@ t of the se@@ ed@@ ; the po@@ et@@ ry of the sh@@ am@@ an was dis@@ plac@@ ed by the pro@@ se of the pri@@ es@@ th@@ oo@@ d@@ ; we created h@@ ier@@ ar@@ ch@@ y speci@@ aliz@@ ation sur@@ pl@@ us -- is only 10@@ ,000 years ago.
The mo@@ dern industri@@ al world as we know it is bar@@ ely 300 years ol@@ d.
Now, that sh@@ allow history doesn't sug@@ gest to me that we have all the answer@@ s for all of the chall@@ eng@@ es that will con@@ front us in the en@@ su@@ ing m@@ ill@@ enn@@ i@@ a.
When these my@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tures of the world are asked the mean@@ ing of being hum@@ an, they respon@@ d with 10@@ ,000 different vo@@ ic@@ es.
And it's within that son@@ g that we will all re@@ dis@@ cover the possi@@ bili@@ ty of being what we ar@@ e: a fully con@@ sci@@ ous speci@@ es, fully a@@ ware of en@@ sur@@ ing that all peopl@@ es and all gar@@ den@@ s find a way to fl@@ our@@ ish@@ . And there are great mom@@ ents of op@@ tim@@ is@@ m.
This is a photogra@@ ph I took at the nor@@ ther@@ n ti@@ p of B@@ aff@@ in Isl@@ and when I went n@@ ar@@ wh@@ al h@@ un@@ ting with some In@@ u@@ it people, and this man, O@@ la@@ y@@ u@@ k, told me a mar@@ vel@@ ous story of his gr@@ and@@ fa@@ ther.
The C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an government has not always been kind to the In@@ u@@ it people, and during the 19@@ 50@@ s, to est@@ ab@@ lis@@ h our so@@ ver@@ eig@@ n@@ ty, we forc@@ ed them into s@@ et@@ tl@@ em@@ ents.
This old man@@ 's gr@@ and@@ fa@@ ther ref@@ used to go.
The fam@@ il@@ y, f@@ ear@@ ful for his life, took away all of his we@@ ap@@ ons, all of his tool@@ s.
Now, you must understand that the In@@ u@@ it did not fe@@ ar the col@@ d@@ ; they took adv@@ ant@@ age of it.
The run@@ n@@ ers of their s@@ le@@ ds were origin@@ ally made of fish w@@ ra@@ pped in car@@ i@@ b@@ o@@ u hi@@ de.
So, this man@@ 's gr@@ and@@ fa@@ ther was not in@@ tim@@ id@@ ated by the Ar@@ c@@ tic n@@ ight or the b@@ liz@@ z@@ ard that was blo@@ w@@ ing.
He simply sli@@ pped out@@ si@@ de, pul@@ led down his se@@ al@@ sk@@ in tr@@ ou@@ ser@@ s and de@@ f@@ ec@@ ated into his h@@ and. And as the f@@ ec@@ es began to fre@@ e@@ z@@ e, he shap@@ ed it into the form of a bl@@ ad@@ e.
He put a sp@@ ra@@ y of s@@ ali@@ v@@ a on the ed@@ ge of the sh@@ it kn@@ if@@ e and as it fin@@ ally fro@@ ze so@@ li@@ d, he but@@ ch@@ er@@ ed a do@@ g with it.
He sk@@ inn@@ ed the do@@ g and impro@@ vis@@ ed a har@@ n@@ ess, took the ri@@ b@@ c@@ age of the do@@ g and impro@@ vis@@ ed a s@@ le@@ d, har@@ n@@ ess@@ ed up an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent do@@ g, and dis@@ appear@@ ed over the ice flo@@ es, sh@@ it kn@@ if@@ e in bel@@ t.
Talk about getting by with no@@ thing. And this, in many ways -- -- is a sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of the res@@ ili@@ ence of the In@@ u@@ it people and of all indi@@ gen@@ ous people around the world.
The C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an government in A@@ pri@@ l of 199@@ 9 gave back to tot@@ al control of the In@@ u@@ it an area of land lar@@ ger than C@@ aliforni@@ a and T@@ ex@@ as put toge@@ ther.
It's our new hom@@ el@@ and. It's called N@@ un@@ av@@ u@@ t.
It's an in@@ dep@@ end@@ ent ter@@ rit@@ or@@ y. They control all min@@ er@@ al resourc@@ es.
An amazing example of how a n@@ ation@@ -@@ state can se@@ ek res@@ tit@@ ution with its people.
And fin@@ ally, in the end, I think it's pretty obvi@@ ous at least to all of all us who@@ 've tra@@ vel@@ ed in these re@@ mo@@ te re@@ ach@@ es of the plan@@ et, to real@@ ize that they're not re@@ mo@@ te at all.
They're hom@@ el@@ ands of som@@ ebo@@ d@@ y.
They repres@@ ent br@@ an@@ ches of the human imagin@@ ation that go back to the da@@ wn of time. And for all of us, the dre@@ ams of these childr@@ en, like the dre@@ ams of our own childr@@ en, become part of the n@@ ak@@ ed ge@@ ogra@@ ph@@ y of hop@@ e.
So, what we're trying to do at the N@@ ational Ge@@ ogra@@ ph@@ ic, fin@@ ally, is, we believe that poli@@ tici@@ ans will never ac@@ comp@@ lis@@ h any@@ thing.
We think that pol@@ em@@ ics -- -- we think that pol@@ em@@ ics are not per@@ su@@ as@@ i@@ ve, but we think that stor@@ y@@ tell@@ ing can change the world, and so we are probably the best stor@@ y@@ tell@@ ing institu@@ tion in the world. We get 3@@ 5 million h@@ its on our web@@ site every mon@@ th.
1@@ 5@@ 6 n@@ ations car@@ ry our tel@@ ev@@ ision ch@@ ann@@ el.
Our mag@@ az@@ ines are read by milli@@ ons.
And what we're doing is a ser@@ ies of jour@@ ne@@ ys to the eth@@ no@@ sp@@ here where we're going to take our audi@@ ence to places of such cul@@ tural w@@ on@@ der that they cannot help but come away da@@ zz@@ led by what they have se@@ en, and ho@@ pe@@ ful@@ ly, there@@ for@@ e, em@@ br@@ ace gra@@ du@@ ally, one by one, the centr@@ al re@@ vel@@ ation of an@@ th@@ rop@@ olog@@ y: that this world des@@ er@@ ves to ex@@ ist in a di@@ verse way, that we can find a way to live in a tr@@ ul@@ y mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tur@@ al, pl@@ ur@@ al@@ ist@@ ic world
where all of the wis@@ dom of all peopl@@ es can con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te to our collec@@ tive well@@ -@@ bein@@ g.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of m@@ ine that I hope will res@@ on@@ ate with other things you've already hear@@ d, and I'll try to make some connec@@ tions my@@ self, in case you mis@@ sed them.
But I want to start with what I call the "@@ off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma@@ ."
The off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma of what@@ ?
The off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma of all Wes@@ tern industri@@ al so@@ c@@ ie@@ ti@@ es.
And the off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma r@@ uns like this@@ : if we are interested in ma@@ x@@ im@@ iz@@ ing the wel@@ f@@ are of our citi@@ z@@ en@@ s, the way to do that is to ma@@ x@@ im@@ ize individu@@ al fre@@ ed@@ om@@ .
The reason for this is both that fre@@ e@@ dom is in and of it@@ self goo@@ d, valu@@ able, wor@@ th@@ wh@@ il@@ e, essenti@@ al to being hum@@ an.
And because if people have fre@@ ed@@ om@@ , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will ma@@ x@@ im@@ ize our wel@@ far@@ e, and no one has to deci@@ de on our beh@@ al@@ f.
The way to ma@@ x@@ im@@ ize fre@@ e@@ dom is to ma@@ x@@ im@@ ize cho@@ ic@@ e.
The more cho@@ ice people ha@@ ve, the more fre@@ e@@ dom they ha@@ ve, and the more fre@@ e@@ dom they ha@@ ve, the more wel@@ f@@ are they ha@@ ve.
Th@@ is, I think, is so de@@ e@@ ply em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in the water sup@@ ply that it wouldn't oc@@ c@@ ur to any@@ one to question it.
And it's also de@@ e@@ ply em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in our li@@ ves.
I'll give you some exampl@@ es of what mo@@ dern progr@@ ess has made possible for us.
This is my super@@ mark@@ et. Not such a big one.
I want to say just a word about s@@ al@@ ad dres@@ s@@ ing.
1@@ 7@@ 5 s@@ al@@ ad dres@@ sing@@ s in my super@@ mark@@ et, if you don't coun@@ t the 10 extra@@ -@@ vir@@ g@@ in o@@ live o@@ il@@ s and 12 bal@@ sam@@ ic v@@ in@@ eg@@ ar@@ s you could buy to make a very large number of your own s@@ al@@ ad dres@@ sing@@ s, in the off@@ -@@ ch@@ ance that n@@ one of the 1@@ 7@@ 5 the stor@@ e has on off@@ er su@@ it you.
So this is what the super@@ market is lik@@ e.
And then you go to the consum@@ er elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ics stor@@ e to set up a ster@@ e@@ o system -- spe@@ ak@@ ers, C@@ D play@@ er, ta@@ pe play@@ er, tun@@ er, amp@@ lif@@ ier -- and in this one single consum@@ er elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ics stor@@ e, there are that many ster@@ e@@ o system@@ s.
We can construc@@ t si@@ x@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a-@@ hal@@ f@@ -@@ million different ster@@ e@@ o systems out of the comp@@ on@@ ents that are on off@@ er in one stor@@ e.
You@@ 've got to ad@@ mit that's a lot of cho@@ ic@@ e.
In other dom@@ ain@@ s -- the world of communic@@ ations.
There was a time, when I was a bo@@ y, when you could get any kind of tel@@ e@@ phone ser@@ vice you wan@@ ted, as long as it came from M@@ a B@@ ell@@ .
You r@@ ented your ph@@ one. You didn't buy it.
One con@@ sequ@@ ence of that, by the way, is that the phone never bro@@ k@@ e.
And those days are g@@ one.
We now have an almost un@@ li@@ mit@@ ed vari@@ et@@ y of ph@@ on@@ es, es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally in the world of cell ph@@ on@@ es.
These are cell ph@@ ones of the fut@@ ure.
My fa@@ vor@@ ite is the middle one -- the M@@ P@@ 3 play@@ er, no@@ se ha@@ ir tri@@ mm@@ er, and cr@@ è@@ me br@@ û@@ l@@ é@@ e tor@@ ch.
And if by some ch@@ ance you ha@@ ven@@ 't seen that in your stor@@ e y@@ et, you can rest as@@ su@@ red that one day so@@ on, you will@@ .
And what this does is it le@@ ad@@ s people to walk into their stor@@ es as@@ king this ques@@ tion.
And do you know what the answer to this question now is@@ ?
The answer is "@@ no@@ ."
It is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much.
So, in other as@@ pec@@ ts of life that are much more sign@@ ific@@ ant than bu@@ ying things, the same expl@@ o@@ sion of cho@@ ice is tru@@ e.
He@@ al@@ th car@@ e. It is no longer the case in the United St@@ ates that you go to the doc@@ tor@@ , and the doc@@ tor tell@@ s you what to do.
In@@ ste@@ ad, you go to the doc@@ tor@@ , and the doc@@ tor tell@@ s you, "Well, we could do A, or we could do B@@ .
A has these ben@@ ef@@ it@@ s, and these ris@@ k@@ s.
B has these ben@@ ef@@ it@@ s, and these ris@@ k@@ s. What do you want to do@@ ?"
And you say, "@@ D@@ oc@@ , what should I do@@ ?"
And the do@@ c says, "@@ A has these ben@@ ef@@ its and ris@@ k@@ s, and B has these ben@@ ef@@ its and ris@@ k@@ s.
What do you want to do@@ ?"
And you say, "@@ If you were me, D@@ oc@@ , what would you do@@ ?"
And the do@@ c says, "@@ But I'm not you@@ ."
And the res@@ ult is -- we call it "@@ pati@@ ent au@@ ton@@ om@@ y@@ ," which makes it sound like a good thing, but it really is a shi@@ f@@ ting of the bur@@ den and the responsi@@ bili@@ ty for dec@@ isi@@ on-@@ making from somebody who kno@@ ws something -- nam@@ ely, the doc@@ tor -- to somebody who kno@@ ws nothing and is almost certain@@ ly si@@ ck and th@@ us not in the best sha@@ pe to be making dec@@ isi@@ ons -- nam@@ ely, the pati@@ ent.
There's enor@@ m@@ ous mark@@ eting of pres@@ c@@ rip@@ tion dru@@ gs to people like you and me, wh@@ ich, if you think about it, makes no sense at all, since we can't buy them.
Why do they market to us if we can't buy them@@ ?
The answer is that they exp@@ ect us to call our doc@@ tors the next mor@@ ning and ask for our pres@@ c@@ rip@@ tions to be chan@@ ge@@ d.
Som@@ e@@ thing as dr@@ am@@ atic as our id@@ ent@@ ity has now become a matter of cho@@ ic@@ e, as this sli@@ de is me@@ ant to in@@ dic@@ ate.
We don't in@@ her@@ it an id@@ ent@@ it@@ y@@ ; we get to inv@@ ent it.
And we get to re@@ -@@ inv@@ ent our@@ selves as often as we lik@@ e.
And that means that every day, when you wa@@ ke up in the mor@@ n@@ ing, you have to deci@@ de what kind of person you want to be.
W@@ ith resp@@ ect to mar@@ ri@@ age and fam@@ il@@ y, there was a time when the de@@ f@@ au@@ l@@ t ass@@ ump@@ tion that almost everyone had is that you got mar@@ ri@@ ed as so@@ on as you c@@ oul@@ d, and then you started having kids as so@@ on as you c@@ oul@@ d.
The only real cho@@ ice was wh@@ o, not wh@@ en, and not what you did af@@ ter.
No@@ wa@@ da@@ ys, everything is very much up for gr@@ ab@@ s.
I te@@ ach wonder@@ fully intelligen@@ t stud@@ ents, and I ass@@ ign 20 percent less work than I used to.
And it's not because they're less s@@ mar@@ t, and it's not because they're less di@@ li@@ gen@@ t.
It's because they are pre@@ oc@@ c@@ up@@ ie@@ d, as@@ king them@@ sel@@ ves, "@@ Sh@@ ould I get mar@@ ri@@ ed or no@@ t? Sh@@ ould I get mar@@ ri@@ ed no@@ w@@ ?
Sh@@ ould I get mar@@ ri@@ ed lat@@ er@@ ? Sh@@ ould I have kids fir@@ st, or a car@@ e@@ er fir@@ st@@ ?"
All of these are consum@@ ing ques@@ tions.
And they're going to answer these ques@@ tions, whether or not it means not doing all the work I ass@@ ign and not getting a good gra@@ de in my cour@@ s@@ es.
And in@@ de@@ ed they sh@@ oul@@ d. These are important ques@@ tions to answer@@ .
Wor@@ k -- we are bl@@ es@@ se@@ d, as Car@@ l was poin@@ ting out, with the technology that en@@ ab@@ les us to work every min@@ ute of every day from any place on the planet -- exc@@ ept the R@@ and@@ ol@@ ph Ho@@ tel@@ .
There is one cor@@ n@@ er, by the way, that I'm not going to tell any@@ body ab@@ out, where the Wi@@ F@@ i actually work@@ s.
I'm not tell@@ ing you about it because I want to use it.
So what this mean@@ s, this incredible fre@@ e@@ dom of cho@@ ice we have with resp@@ ect to work, is that we have to make a dec@@ isi@@ on, ag@@ ain and ag@@ ain and again, about whether we should or sh@@ ouldn't be work@@ ing.
We can go to wat@@ ch our ki@@ d play so@@ cc@@ er, and we have our cell phone on one hi@@ p, and our Bl@@ ack@@ ber@@ ry on our other hi@@ p, and our l@@ ap@@ to@@ p, pres@@ um@@ abl@@ y, on our l@@ ap@@ s.
And even if they're all sh@@ ut off@@ , every min@@ ute that we're wat@@ ching our ki@@ d mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ate a so@@ cc@@ er gam@@ e, we are also as@@ king our@@ sel@@ ves, "@@ Sh@@ ould I answer this cell phone call@@ ?
Sh@@ ould I respon@@ d to this em@@ ail@@ ? Sh@@ ould I dra@@ ft this let@@ ter@@ ?"
And even if the answer to the question is "@@ no@@ ," it's certain@@ ly going to make the experience of your kid@@ 's so@@ cc@@ er game very different than it w@@ oul@@ d@@ 've be@@ en.
So every@@ where we loo@@ k, big things and small things, materi@@ al things and lif@@ est@@ y@@ le things, life is a matter of cho@@ ic@@ e.
And the world we used to live in looked like this.
That is to say, there were some cho@@ ic@@ es, but not everything was a matter of cho@@ ic@@ e.
And the world we now live in looks like this.
And the question is, is this good new@@ s, or bad new@@ s?
And the answer is, "@@ y@@ es@@ ."
We all know what's good about it, so I'm going to talk about what's bad about it.
All of this cho@@ ice has two effec@@ ts, two neg@@ ative effec@@ ts on people.
One effec@@ t, par@@ a@@ do@@ x@@ ic@@ ally, is that it produc@@ es par@@ aly@@ s@@ is, rather than li@@ ber@@ ation.
W@@ ith so many op@@ tions to ch@@ oo@@ se fro@@ m, people find it very diffic@@ ult to ch@@ oo@@ se at all.
I'll give you one very dr@@ am@@ atic example of this@@ : a study that was done of inv@@ est@@ ments in vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment plan@@ s.
A col@@ le@@ ag@@ ue of m@@ ine got acc@@ ess to inv@@ est@@ ment rec@@ or@@ ds from V@@ ang@@ u@@ ar@@ d, the g@@ ig@@ an@@ tic mut@@ u@@ al@@ -@@ f@@ und company of about a million em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es and about 2@@ ,000 different work@@ plac@@ es.
And what she found is that for every 10 mut@@ ual fund@@ s the em@@ plo@@ y@@ er o@@ ffer@@ ed, rate of par@@ tici@@ p@@ ation went down two perc@@ ent.
You off@@ er 50 fund@@ s -- 10 percent fe@@ wer em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es par@@ tici@@ p@@ ate than if you only off@@ er fi@@ ve. Wh@@ y?
Because with 50 fund@@ s to ch@@ oo@@ se fro@@ m, it's so dam@@ n hard to deci@@ de which f@@ und to ch@@ oo@@ se, that you'll just put it off until tom@@ or@@ ro@@ w.
And then tom@@ or@@ ro@@ w, and tom@@ or@@ ro@@ w, and tom@@ or@@ ro@@ w, and of course tom@@ or@@ row never com@@ es.
Un@@ der@@ stand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to e@@ at do@@ g food when they re@@ ti@@ re because they don't have enough money put a@@ way, it also means that making the dec@@ ision is so hard that they pas@@ s up sign@@ ific@@ ant mat@@ ching money from the em@@ plo@@ y@@ er.
B@@ y not par@@ tici@@ pat@@ ing, they are pas@@ sing up as much as 5@@ ,000 dollars a year from the em@@ plo@@ y@@ er, who would happ@@ ily mat@@ ch their con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion.
So par@@ aly@@ s@@ is is a con@@ sequ@@ ence of having too many cho@@ ic@@ es.
And I think it makes the world look like this. [@@ And la@@ st@@ ly, for all et@@ ern@@ ity, Fr@@ en@@ ch, ble@@ u che@@ es@@ e, or ran@@ ch@@ ?@@ ] You really want to get the dec@@ ision right if it's for all et@@ ern@@ ity, right?
You don't want to pic@@ k the wrong mut@@ ual f@@ und, or the wrong s@@ al@@ ad dres@@ s@@ ing.
So that's one effec@@ t. The second eff@@ ect is that even if we man@@ age to over@@ come the par@@ aly@@ s@@ is and make a cho@@ ic@@ e, we end up less sat@@ is@@ fi@@ ed with the res@@ ult of the cho@@ ice than we would be if we had fe@@ wer op@@ tions to ch@@ oo@@ se fro@@ m.
And there are sever@@ al reas@@ ons for this.
is that with a lot of different s@@ al@@ ad dres@@ sing@@ s to ch@@ oo@@ se fro@@ m, if you buy one, and it's not perf@@ ect -- and what s@@ al@@ ad dres@@ sing is@@ ? -- it's eas@@ y to imagine you could have made a different cho@@ ice that would have been bet@@ ter. And what happens is this imagin@@ ed al@@ tern@@ ative in@@ duc@@ es you to re@@ gre@@ t the dec@@ ision you ma@@ de, and this re@@ gre@@ t sub@@ trac@@ ts from the sat@@ is@@ fac@@ tion you get out of the dec@@ ision you ma@@ de,
even if it was a good dec@@ isi@@ on.
The more op@@ tions there are, the eas@@ ier it is to re@@ gre@@ t anything at all that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting about the op@@ tion that you cho@@ se.
S@@ econ@@ d, what econom@@ ists call "@@ opportun@@ ity co@@ st@@ s."
D@@ an G@@ il@@ bert made a big point this mor@@ ning of talking about how much the way in which we val@@ ue things dep@@ ends on what we comp@@ are them to.
Well, when there are lots of al@@ tern@@ ati@@ ves to consi@@ der, it is eas@@ y to imagine the at@@ trac@@ tive fe@@ atur@@ es of al@@ tern@@ ati@@ ves that you re@@ jec@@ t that make you less sat@@ is@@ fi@@ ed with the al@@ tern@@ ative that you've cho@@ s@@ en.
Here's an exampl@@ e. [@@ I can't stop thinking about those other av@@ ail@@ able par@@ king spac@@ es on W 8@@ 5@@ th stre@@ et@@ ] S@@ or@@ ry if you're not New Yor@@ ker@@ s.
Here's what you're sup@@ posed to be think@@ ing.
Here's this couple on the H@@ amp@@ ton@@ s.
Ver@@ y exp@@ en@@ sive real est@@ ate.
G@@ or@@ ge@@ ous be@@ ach@@ . Be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful day. They have it all to them@@ sel@@ ves.
What could be bet@@ ter@@ ?
"Well, dam@@ n it@@ ," this guy is think@@ ing, "@@ It's Au@@ gu@@ st. Every@@ body in my Man@@ hat@@ t@@ an neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od is a@@ way.
I could be par@@ king right in front of my build@@ ing@@ ."
And he sp@@ ends two week@@ s n@@ ag@@ g@@ ed by the idea that he is mis@@ sing the opportun@@ ity, day after day, to have a great par@@ king spac@@ e.
sub@@ tr@@ act from the sat@@ is@@ fac@@ tion we get out of what we ch@@ oo@@ se, even when what we ch@@ oo@@ se is terri@@ f@@ ic.
And the more op@@ tions there are to consi@@ der, the more at@@ trac@@ tive fe@@ atur@@ es of these op@@ tions are going to be ref@@ lec@@ ted by us as opportun@@ ity co@@ st@@ s.
Here's another exampl@@ e.
Now this car@@ to@@ on makes a lot of poin@@ ts.
It makes poin@@ ts about living in the moment as well, and probably about doing things s@@ low@@ ly.
But one point it makes is that wh@@ en@@ ever you're ch@@ oo@@ sing one thing, you're ch@@ oo@@ sing not to do other things that may have lots of at@@ trac@@ tive fe@@ atur@@ es, and it's going to make what you're doing less at@@ tr@@ activ@@ e.
Th@@ ir@@ d@@ : es@@ cal@@ ation of exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations.
This h@@ it me when I went to re@@ place my je@@ an@@ s.
I we@@ ar je@@ ans almost all the time.
There was a time when je@@ ans came in one fl@@ a@@ vor@@ , and you b@@ ought them, and they f@@ it like cra@@ p, they were incredi@@ bly un@@ com@@ fort@@ able, if you wor@@ e them and was@@ h@@ ed them enough tim@@ es, they started to feel OK.
I went to re@@ place my je@@ ans after years of we@@ ar@@ ing these old on@@ es, and I said, "I want a pa@@ ir of je@@ an@@ s. Here's my si@@ z@@ e."
And the sho@@ p@@ ke@@ ep@@ er said, "@@ Do you want sli@@ m f@@ it, eas@@ y f@@ it, rel@@ ax@@ ed f@@ it?
You want but@@ ton f@@ ly or zi@@ pp@@ er fl@@ y? You want st@@ on@@ e@@ was@@ h@@ ed or ac@@ id@@ -@@ was@@ he@@ d?
Do you want them dist@@ res@@ se@@ d?
You want boo@@ t cu@@ t, ta@@ per@@ ed, bl@@ ah bl@@ ah@@ ." On and on he wen@@ t.
My j@@ a@@ w dro@@ p@@ pe@@ d. And after I re@@ cover@@ ed, I said, "I want the kind that used to be the only kin@@ d@@ ."
He had no idea what that was, so I spent an h@@ our trying on all these dam@@ n je@@ an@@ s, and I wal@@ ked out of the stor@@ e -- tru@@ th@@ ! -- with the bes@@ t@@ -@@ f@@ it@@ ting je@@ ans I had ever ha@@ d.
I did bet@@ ter. All this cho@@ ice made it possible for me to do bet@@ ter.
But -- I felt wor@@ se.
Wh@@ y? I wrote a whole book to try to ex@@ pla@@ in this to my@@ self.
The reason I felt wor@@ se is that, with all of these op@@ tions av@@ ail@@ able, my exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations about how good a pa@@ ir of je@@ ans should be went up.
I had very lo@@ w, no particular exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations when they only came in one fl@@ a@@ vor@@ .
When they came in 100 fl@@ a@@ vor@@ s, dam@@ n it, one of them sh@@ oul@@ d@@ 've been perf@@ ec@@ t.
And what I got was goo@@ d, but it wasn't perf@@ ec@@ t.
And so I com@@ par@@ ed what I got to what I exp@@ ec@@ ted, and what I got was dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting in com@@ par@@ is@@ on to what I exp@@ ec@@ ted.
A@@ d@@ ding op@@ tions to peopl@@ e's lives can't help but incre@@ ase the exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations people have about how good those op@@ tions will be.
And what that's going to produ@@ ce is less sat@@ is@@ fac@@ tion with resul@@ ts, even when they're good resul@@ ts.
No@@ body in the world of mark@@ eting kno@@ ws this.
[@@ It all looks so gre@@ at. I can't wa@@ it to be dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ te@@ d@@ .@@ ] Because if they di@@ d, you wouldn't all know what this was ab@@ out.
The tr@@ ut@@ h is more like this.
[@@ Every@@ thing was better back when everything was wor@@ se@@ ] The reason that everything was better back when everything was wor@@ se is that when everything was wor@@ se, it was actually possible for people to have experi@@ ences that were a pleas@@ ant sur@@ pris@@ e.
No@@ wa@@ da@@ ys, the world we live in -- we aff@@ lu@@ ent, industri@@ al@@ ized citi@@ z@@ en@@ s, with perf@@ ec@@ tion the exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you exp@@ ect it to be.
You will never be pleas@@ ant@@ ly sur@@ pris@@ ed because your exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations, my exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations, have gone through the ro@@ of@@ .
The sec@@ re@@ t to happin@@ ess -- this is what you all came for -- the sec@@ re@@ t to happin@@ ess is low exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations.
I want to say -- just a little au@@ to@@ bi@@ ogra@@ ph@@ ical moment -- that I actually am mar@@ ri@@ ed to a wi@@ f@@ e, and sh@@ e's really quite wonder@@ ful@@ .
I couldn't have done bet@@ ter. I didn't s@@ et@@ tl@@ e.
But s@@ et@@ tl@@ ing isn't always such a bad thing.
Fin@@ ally -- One con@@ sequ@@ ence of bu@@ ying a b@@ ad@@ -@@ f@@ it@@ ting pa@@ ir of je@@ ans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dis@@ sat@@ is@@ f@@ ie@@ d, and you ask wh@@ y, who's responsi@@ bl@@ e, the answer is clear@@ : the world is responsi@@ ble.
What could you do@@ ?
When there are hundre@@ ds of different st@@ y@@ les of je@@ ans av@@ ail@@ able, and you buy one that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ing, and you ask wh@@ y, who's responsi@@ ble@@ ?
It is equ@@ ally clear that the answer to the question is "@@ you@@ ."
You could have done bet@@ ter.
W@@ ith a hund@@ red different kinds of je@@ ans on dis@@ pla@@ y, there is no exc@@ use for fail@@ ure.
And so when people make dec@@ isi@@ ons, and even though the resul@@ ts of the dec@@ isi@@ ons are goo@@ d, they feel dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted about them@@ ; they bl@@ ame them@@ sel@@ ves.
C@@ lin@@ ical de@@ pres@@ sion has expl@@ o@@ ded in the industri@@ al world in the last gener@@ ation.
I believe a sign@@ ific@@ ant -- not the on@@ ly, but a sign@@ ific@@ ant -- con@@ tri@@ but@@ or to this expl@@ o@@ sion of de@@ pres@@ sion, and also su@@ ici@@ de, is that people have experi@@ ences that are dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting because their stand@@ ar@@ ds are so high@@ , and then when they have to ex@@ pla@@ in these experi@@ ences to them@@ sel@@ ves, they think they're at f@@ au@@ l@@ t.
And so the net res@@ ult is that we do better in gener@@ al, objec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y, and we feel wor@@ se.
So let me re@@ mind you.
This is the off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma@@ , the one that we all take to be tru@@ e, and it's all fal@@ se. It is not tru@@ e.
There's no question that some cho@@ ice is better than n@@ one, but it doesn't fol@@ low from that that more cho@@ ice is better than some cho@@ ic@@ e.
There's some mag@@ ical amoun@@ t. I don't know what it is.
I'm pretty con@@ fi@@ d@@ ent that we have long since pas@@ sed the point where op@@ tions impro@@ ve our wel@@ far@@ e.
Now, as a po@@ lic@@ y matter -- I'm almost done -- as a po@@ lic@@ y mat@@ ter, the thing to think about is this@@ : what en@@ ab@@ les all of this cho@@ ice in industri@@ al so@@ c@@ ie@@ ties is materi@@ al aff@@ lu@@ ence.
There are lots of places in the world, and we have heard about sever@@ al of them, where their problem is not that they have too much cho@@ ic@@ e.
Th@@ ei@@ r problem is that they have too litt@@ le.
So the stuff I'm talking about is the pec@@ u@@ li@@ ar problem of moder@@ n, aff@@ lu@@ ent, Wes@@ tern so@@ c@@ ie@@ ti@@ es.
And what is so f@@ ru@@ str@@ ating and in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ating is this@@ : Ste@@ ve L@@ ev@@ it@@ t talked to you y@@ es@@ ter@@ day about how these exp@@ en@@ sive and diffic@@ ul@@ t-@@ to@@ -@@ inst@@ all child se@@ at@@ s don't hel@@ p.
It's a wa@@ ste of mone@@ y.
What I'm tell@@ ing you is that these exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve, comp@@ lic@@ ated cho@@ ic@@ es -- it's not simply that they don't hel@@ p.
They actually h@@ ur@@ t.
They actually make us wor@@ se off@@ .
If some of what en@@ ab@@ les people in our so@@ c@@ ie@@ ties to make all of the cho@@ ic@@ es we make were shi@@ f@@ ted to so@@ c@@ ie@@ ties in which people have too few op@@ tions, not only would those peopl@@ e's lives be impro@@ v@@ ed, but our@@ s would be impro@@ ved also, which is what econom@@ ists call a "@@ Par@@ et@@ o-@@ impro@@ ving mov@@ e."
In@@ come re@@ di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion will make everyone better off -- not just po@@ or people -- because of how all this exc@@ ess cho@@ ice pl@@ ag@@ u@@ es us.
So to conc@@ lu@@ de. [@@ You can be anything you want to be -- no li@@ mit@@ s@@ ] You're sup@@ posed to read this car@@ to@@ on, and, being a soph@@ ist@@ ic@@ ated person@@ , say, "A@@ h@@ ! What does this fish know@@ ?
You know, nothing is possible in this f@@ ish@@ bo@@ w@@ l@@ ."
Im@@ po@@ ver@@ ish@@ ed imagin@@ ation, a my@@ op@@ ic view of the world -- and that's the way I read it at fir@@ st.
The more I thought about it, ho@@ we@@ ver, the more I came to the view that this fish kno@@ ws some@@ thing.
Because the tr@@ ut@@ h of the matter is that if you s@@ hat@@ ter the f@@ ish@@ bo@@ w@@ l so that everything is possi@@ bl@@ e, you don't have fre@@ ed@@ om@@ . You have par@@ aly@@ s@@ is.
If you s@@ hat@@ ter this f@@ ish@@ bo@@ w@@ l so that everything is possi@@ bl@@ e, you de@@ cre@@ ase sat@@ is@@ fac@@ tion.
You incre@@ ase par@@ aly@@ s@@ is, and you de@@ cre@@ ase sat@@ is@@ fac@@ tion.
Every@@ body needs a f@@ ish@@ bo@@ w@@ l@@ .
This one is almost certain@@ ly too li@@ mit@@ ed -- perhaps even for the f@@ is@@ h, certain@@ ly for us.
But the ab@@ sen@@ ce of some met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical f@@ ish@@ bo@@ w@@ l is a re@@ ci@@ pe for mis@@ er@@ y, and, I s@@ us@@ pec@@ t, dis@@ ast@@ er.
Thank you very much.
