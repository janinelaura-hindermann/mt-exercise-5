L@@ ast ye@@ ar I sho@@ w@@ ed these two s@@ li@@ des so that de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate that the ar@@ c@@ ti@@ c ice cap@@ , which for most of the last three million years has been the si@@ ze of the lo@@ wer 4@@ 8 stat@@ es, has s@@ hr@@ un@@ k by 4@@ 0 perc@@ ent.
But this under@@ stat@@ es the ser@@ i@@ ous@@ n@@ ess of this par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar pro@@ blem because it doesn't show the th@@ ick@@ n@@ ess of the ic@@ e.
The ar@@ c@@ ti@@ c ice c@@ a@@ p is, in a sen@@ se, the be@@ ating hear@@ t of the glob@@ al c@@ lim@@ ate system@@ .
It exp@@ and@@ s in win@@ ter and con@@ tr@@ ac@@ ts in sum@@ mer@@ .
The next s@@ li@@ de I show you will be a ra@@ pi@@ d f@@ ast@@ -@@ for@@ war@@ d of wh@@ at's happen@@ ed over the last 2@@ 5 year@@ s.
The per@@ man@@ ent ice is mar@@ ked in re@@ d.
A@@ s you se@@ e, it exp@@ and@@ s to the dar@@ k bl@@ u@@ e -- that's the an@@ nu@@ al ice in w@@ inter@@ , and it con@@ tr@@ ac@@ ts in sum@@ mer@@ .
The so@@ -@@ called per@@ man@@ ent ic@@ e, fi@@ ve years old or ol@@ der@@ , you can see is al@@ most like b@@ loo@@ d, sp@@ ill@@ ing out of the body here.
In 2@@ 5 years it's g@@ one from this, to this.
This is a pro@@ blem because the war@@ m@@ ing he@@ at@@ s up the fro@@ zen gro@@ und around the Ar@@ c@@ ti@@ c O@@ c@@ e@@ an, where there is a m@@ as@@ si@@ ve am@@ oun@@ t of fro@@ zen car@@ b@@ on wh@@ ich, when it th@@ a@@ w@@ s, is tur@@ n@@ ed into me@@ th@@ an@@ e by m@@ ic@@ ro@@ bes@@ .

In the H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ as@@ , the th@@ ir@@ d lar@@ ges@@ t m@@ as@@ s of ic@@ e: at the to@@ p you see new l@@ ak@@ es, which a few years ag@@ o were gl@@ ac@@ ier@@ s.
4@@ 0 percent of all the people in the world get hal@@ f of their dr@@ in@@ king wat@@ er from that m@@ el@@ ting f@@ lo@@ w.

In C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a there has been a 4@@ 0 percent de@@ c@@ l@@ ine in the S@@ ier@@ r@@ a s@@ no@@ w@@ p@@ ac@@ k.

If you look at in the con@@ t@@ ex@@ t of h@@ ist@@ or@@ y you can see what this is do@@ ing.
In the last fi@@ ve years we've ad@@ ded 7@@ 0 million t@@ ons of C@@ O@@ 2 every 2@@ 4 h@@ our@@ s -- 2@@ 5 million t@@ ons every day to the oc@@ e@@ an@@ s.

Th@@ is, all over the coun@@ tr@@ y, is the secon@@ d lar@@ ges@@ t wa@@ ste st@@ re@@ am in Americ@@ a.

L@@ ast ye@@ ar at TED I ga@@ ve an in@@ tro@@ duc@@ tion to the L@@ H@@ C@@ .
And I pro@@ mis@@ ed to come back and give you an up@@ d@@ ate on how that mach@@ ine wor@@ k@@ ed.
So this is it. And for those of you that wer@@ en@@ 't ther@@ e, the L@@ H@@ C is the lar@@ ges@@ t sci@@ enti@@ f@@ ic exper@@ im@@ ent ever at@@ tem@@ p@@ ted -- 2@@ 7 k@@ il@@ om@@ et@@ ers in c@@ ir@@ c@@ um@@ fer@@ enc@@ e.
I@@ ts j@@ ob is to re@@ cre@@ ate the con@@ diti@@ ons that were pres@@ ent l@@ ess than a b@@ illi@@ on@@ th of a secon@@ d after the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se be@@ gan@@ , up to 6@@ 00 million tim@@ es a secon@@ d.
It's no@@ thing if not am@@ b@@ iti@@ ou@@ s.
This is the mach@@ ine bel@@ o@@ w Gen@@ ev@@ a.
We take the pic@@ tur@@ es of those min@@ i@@ -@@ Bi@@ g B@@ ang@@ s in@@ side d@@ et@@ ec@@ tor@@ s.
This is the one I work on. It's called the A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S d@@ et@@ ec@@ t@@ or -- 4@@ 4 m@@ et@@ ers wi@@ de, 2@@ 2 m@@ et@@ ers in di@@ am@@ et@@ er.
Sp@@ ec@@ t@@ ac@@ ul@@ ar pic@@ ture here of A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S un@@ der con@@ stru@@ c@@ tion so you can see the sc@@ al@@ e.
O@@ n the 1@@ 0@@ th of S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber last ye@@ ar we tur@@ n@@ ed the mach@@ ine on for the first time.
And this pic@@ ture was ta@@ ken by A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S@@ .
It c@@ aus@@ ed imm@@ en@@ se c@@ el@@ eb@@ r@@ ation in the con@@ tro@@ l ro@@ om@@ .
It's a pic@@ ture of the first be@@ am par@@ tic@@ le going all the way around the L@@ H@@ C@@ , col@@ li@@ ding with a pi@@ ec@@ e of the L@@ H@@ C del@@ i@@ ber@@ at@@ el@@ y, and sho@@ wer@@ ing par@@ tic@@ les into the d@@ et@@ ec@@ tor@@ .
In other wor@@ d@@ s, when we sa@@ w that pic@@ ture on S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 1@@ 0@@ th we k@@ new the mach@@ ine wor@@ k@@ ed, which is a great tri@@ um@@ ph@@ .
I don't know wh@@ e@@ ther this got the b@@ ig@@ ges@@ t ch@@ e@@ er, or this, when some@@ one went on@@ to Go@@ og@@ le and sa@@ w the fr@@ on@@ t p@@ age was like that.
It me@@ ans we made cul@@ tur@@ al imp@@ ac@@ t as wel@@ l as sci@@ enti@@ f@@ ic imp@@ ac@@ t.
Ab@@ out a we@@ e@@ k lat@@ er we had a pro@@ blem with the mach@@ in@@ e, rel@@ ated actually to these b@@ its of wir@@ e here -- these g@@ old wir@@ es.
Th@@ o@@ se wir@@ es car@@ ry 1@@ 3 thou@@ s@@ and am@@ ps when the mach@@ ine is wor@@ king in ful@@ l po@@ wer@@ .
Now the eng@@ in@@ e@@ ers am@@ ong@@ st you will look at them and say, "@@ N@@ o they don@@ '@@ t. Th@@ ey@@ 're sm@@ all wir@@ es@@ ."
They can do that because when they are very c@@ old they are wh@@ at's called su@@ per@@ con@@ duc@@ ting wi@@ re.
So at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 de@@ gre@@ es, col@@ der than the spac@@ e between the star@@ s, those wir@@ es can take that c@@ ur@@ r@@ ent.
In one of the j@@ o@@ in@@ ts between over 9@@ ,000 mag@@ net@@ s in L@@ H@@ C@@ , there was a man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing de@@ f@@ ec@@ t.
So the wir@@ e he@@ ated up s@@ li@@ gh@@ tl@@ y, and its 1@@ 3@@ ,000 am@@ ps su@@ d@@ den@@ ly en@@ co@@ unter@@ ed el@@ ec@@ tri@@ c@@ al res@@ ist@@ anc@@ e.
This was the res@@ ul@@ t.
Now that's more imp@@ res@@ si@@ ve when you con@@ si@@ der those mag@@ net@@ s wei@@ gh over 20 t@@ on@@ s, and they mo@@ ved about a foo@@ t.
So we dam@@ ag@@ ed about 50 of the mag@@ net@@ s.
We had to take them ou@@ t, which we di@@ d.
We re@@ con@@ diti@@ on@@ ed them all@@ , fi@@ x@@ ed them.
Th@@ ey@@ 're all on their way back under@@ gro@@ und no@@ w.
B@@ y the end of Mar@@ ch the L@@ H@@ C will be in@@ t@@ ac@@ t again@@ .
We will s@@ wit@@ ch it on, and we exp@@ ect to take dat@@ a in J@@ un@@ e or J@@ ul@@ y, and con@@ tin@@ u@@ e with our qu@@ est to find out what the build@@ ing b@@ lo@@ ck@@ s of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se ar@@ e.
Now of cour@@ se, in a way those ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents r@@ ei@@ g@@ n@@ ite the de@@ b@@ ate about the v@@ al@@ u@@ e of sci@@ ence and eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing at the ed@@ g@@ e. It's eas@@ y to re@@ f@@ ut@@ e.
I think that the fac@@ t that it's so di@@ ff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t, the fac@@ t that we're o@@ ver@@ re@@ ach@@ ing, is the v@@ al@@ u@@ e of things like the L@@ H@@ C@@ .
I will le@@ a@@ ve the fin@@ al wor@@ d to an En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h sci@@ enti@@ st, H@@ um@@ ph@@ re@@ y D@@ av@@ y, wh@@ o, I s@@ us@@ p@@ ec@@ t, when de@@ f@@ end@@ ing his pro@@ te@@ ge@@ 's us@@ el@@ ess exper@@ im@@ ents -- his pro@@ te@@ ge was M@@ ich@@ a@@ el F@@ ar@@ a@@ day -- said this, "@@ No@@ thing is so d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous to the pro@@ gr@@ ess of the human m@@ ind than to ass@@ um@@ e that our vie@@ ws of sci@@ ence are ul@@ tim@@ at@@ e, that there are no m@@ y@@ st@@ eri@@ es in nat@@ u@@ re, that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are compl@@ et@@ e, and that there are no new worl@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er@@ ."
Thank you.
I want to start out by as@@ king you to think back to when you were a ki@@ d, pla@@ ying with b@@ lo@@ ck@@ s.
A@@ s you f@@ ig@@ u@@ red out how to re@@ ach out and gr@@ as@@ p@@ , pic@@ k them up and mo@@ ve them ar@@ oun@@ d, you were actually lear@@ ning how to think and sol@@ ve problem@@ s by under@@ stand@@ ing and man@@ i@@ pul@@ ating sp@@ ati@@ al rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p@@ s.
Sp@@ ati@@ al reas@@ on@@ ing is de@@ e@@ pl@@ y con@@ nec@@ ted to how we under@@ stand a lot of the world around us@@ .
So, as a comp@@ uter sci@@ ent@@ ist in@@ sp@@ i@@ red by this u@@ ti@@ li@@ ty of our inter@@ ac@@ tions with ph@@ ysi@@ c@@ al ob@@ jec@@ ts -- al@@ ong with my ad@@ vis@@ er P@@ at@@ ti@@ e, and my c@@ oll@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ or J@@ e@@ ev@@ an K@@ al@@ an@@ i@@ th@@ i -- I started to w@@ on@@ der -- what if when we used a comp@@ u@@ ter, in@@ ste@@ ad of ha@@ ving this one m@@ ou@@ se c@@ ur@@ s@@ or that was a like a dig@@ it@@ al f@@ ing@@ er@@ ti@@ p mo@@ ving around a fl@@ at des@@ k@@ to@@ p@@ , what if we could re@@ ach in with bo@@ th h@@ and@@ s and gr@@ as@@ p in@@ form@@ ation ph@@ ysi@@ call@@ y,
ar@@ r@@ ang@@ ing it the way we wan@@ te@@ d@@ ?
This ques@@ tion was so comp@@ ell@@ ing that we de@@ ci@@ ded to ex@@ pl@@ or@@ e the ans@@ wer@@ , by build@@ ing Si@@ ft@@ abl@@ es.
In a n@@ ut@@ sh@@ ell, a Si@@ ft@@ able is an inter@@ ac@@ tive comp@@ uter the si@@ ze of a co@@ ok@@ i@@ e.
Th@@ ey@@ 're able to be mo@@ ved around by h@@ and, they can sen@@ se each other@@ , they can sen@@ se their mo@@ tion, and they have a s@@ cre@@ en and a wir@@ el@@ ess ra@@ di@@ o.
Mo@@ st import@@ ant@@ ly, they're ph@@ ysi@@ c@@ al, so like the b@@ lo@@ ck@@ s, you can mo@@ ve them just by re@@ ach@@ ing out and gr@@ as@@ p@@ ing.
And Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les are an exam@@ ple of a new ec@@ o@@ system of to@@ ol@@ s for man@@ i@@ pul@@ ating dig@@ it@@ al in@@ form@@ ation.
And as these to@@ ol@@ s be@@ come more ph@@ ysi@@ c@@ al, more a@@ w@@ are of their mo@@ tion, a@@ w@@ are of each other@@ , and a@@ w@@ are of the nu@@ ance of how we mo@@ ve them@@ , we can start to ex@@ pl@@ or@@ e some new and fu@@ n inter@@ ac@@ tion st@@ y@@ l@@ es.
So, I'm going to start with some sim@@ ple exam@@ pl@@ es.
This Si@@ ft@@ able is con@@ f@@ ig@@ u@@ red to show vi@@ de@@ o, and if I ti@@ l@@ t it in one di@@ rec@@ tion, it@@ 'll ro@@ ll the vi@@ de@@ o this wa@@ y@@ ; if I ti@@ l@@ t it the other way it ro@@ ll@@ s it bac@@ k@@ war@@ d@@ s.
And these inter@@ ac@@ tive p@@ ort@@ ra@@ its are a@@ w@@ are of each other@@ .
So if I put them next to each other@@ , they get interes@@ te@@ d.
If they get sur@@ ro@@ un@@ de@@ d, they no@@ ti@@ ce that to@@ o, they might get a little fl@@ u@@ ster@@ ed.
And they can also sen@@ se their mo@@ tion and ti@@ l@@ t.
O@@ ne of the interes@@ ting imp@@ lic@@ ations on inter@@ ac@@ tion, we started to real@@ iz@@ e, was that we could use every@@ day ges@@ tur@@ es on dat@@ a, like p@@ our@@ ing a col@@ or the way we might p@@ our a li@@ qu@@ i@@ d.
So in this c@@ as@@ e, we've got three Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les con@@ f@@ ig@@ u@@ red to be pa@@ in@@ t bu@@ ck@@ et@@ s and I can use them to p@@ our col@@ or into that cent@@ r@@ al on@@ e, where they get m@@ i@@ x@@ ed.
If we o@@ vers@@ ho@@ o@@ t, we can p@@ our a little bit bac@@ k.
There are also some ne@@ at possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ti@@ es for e@@ duc@@ ation, like lang@@ u@@ ag@@ e, mat@@ h and lo@@ gi@@ c g@@ am@@ es where we want to give people the ab@@ ili@@ ty to try things qu@@ ic@@ kl@@ y, and vie@@ w the res@@ ul@@ ts im@@ me@@ di@@ at@@ el@@ y.
So here I'm -- This is a F@@ i@@ b@@ on@@ acc@@ i se@@ qu@@ ence that I'm ma@@ king with a sim@@ ple e@@ qu@@ ation pro@@ gr@@ am@@ .
H@@ ere we have a wor@@ d g@@ ame that's kind of like a m@@ as@@ h@@ -@@ up between S@@ c@@ r@@ ab@@ ble and B@@ og@@ gl@@ e.
B@@ as@@ ic@@ ally, in every ro@@ und you get a r@@ and@@ om@@ ly ass@@ ign@@ ed l@@ et@@ ter on each Si@@ ft@@ abl@@ e, and as you try to make wor@@ ds it ch@@ ec@@ ks again@@ st a dic@@ tion@@ ar@@ y.
Th@@ en, after about 3@@ 0 secon@@ d@@ s, it res@@ h@@ u@@ ff@@ l@@ es, and you have a new se@@ t of l@@ et@@ ter@@ s and new possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ti@@ es to tr@@ y.
Thank you.
So these are some ki@@ ds that came on a f@@ iel@@ d tri@@ p to the Me@@ di@@ a L@@ ab@@ , and I man@@ ag@@ ed to get them to try it ou@@ t, and sho@@ o@@ t a vi@@ de@@ o.
They really lo@@ ved it.
An@@ d, one of the interes@@ ting things about this kind of a@@ pp@@ lic@@ ation is that you don't have to give people many in@@ stru@@ c@@ tion@@ s.
Al@@ l you have to say is, "@@ Ma@@ ke wor@@ d@@ s@@ ," and they know ex@@ ac@@ t@@ ly what to do@@ .
So her@@ e's another few people tr@@ ying it ou@@ t.
That's our y@@ o@@ ung@@ est bet@@ a t@@ es@@ ter, down there on the righ@@ t.
T@@ ur@@ n@@ s ou@@ t, all he wanted to do was to st@@ ack the Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les up@@ .
So to h@@ im@@ , they were just b@@ lo@@ ck@@ s.
Now, this is an inter@@ ac@@ tive car@@ to@@ on a@@ pp@@ lic@@ ation.
And we wanted to bu@@ ild a lear@@ ning to@@ o@@ l for lang@@ u@@ age lear@@ n@@ er@@ s.
And this is F@@ el@@ i@@ x@@ , actu@@ all@@ y.
And he can br@@ ing new ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ s into the sc@@ en@@ e, just by lif@@ ting the Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les off the t@@ able that have that ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter sho@@ wn on them.
Her@@ e, h@@ e's bring@@ ing the su@@ n ou@@ t.
D@@ a@@ vi@@ d M@@ er@@ ri@@ ll@@ : Now h@@ e's br@@ ou@@ ght a tr@@ ac@@ t@@ or into the sc@@ en@@ e.
G@@ oo@@ d j@@ ob@@ ! Y@@ e@@ ah@@ !
D@@ M@@ : So by s@@ ha@@ king the Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les and p@@ ut@@ ting them next to each other he can make the ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ s inter@@ ac@@ t -- V@@ ide@@ o@@ : W@@ oo@@ f@@ !
D@@ M@@ : inv@@ ent@@ ing his own n@@ ar@@ r@@ ati@@ ve.
D@@ M@@ : It's an op@@ en@@ -@@ end@@ ed stor@@ y, and he get@@ s to de@@ ci@@ de how it un@@ fol@@ d@@ s.
D@@ M@@ : So, the last exam@@ ple I have time to show you to@@ day is a mus@@ ic se@@ qu@@ enc@@ ing and li@@ ve per@@ for@@ man@@ ce to@@ o@@ l that we've bu@@ il@@ t rec@@ ent@@ ly, in which Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les ac@@ t as so@@ und@@ s like le@@ a@@ d, bas@@ s and dr@@ um@@ s.
E@@ ach of these has f@@ our different v@@ ari@@ ation@@ s, you get to ch@@ oo@@ se which one you want to us@@ e.
And you can in@@ jec@@ t these so@@ und@@ s into a se@@ qu@@ ence that you can ass@@ em@@ ble into the p@@ at@@ tern that you wan@@ t.
And you in@@ jec@@ t it by just b@@ um@@ p@@ ing up the so@@ und Si@@ ft@@ able again@@ st a se@@ qu@@ ence Si@@ ft@@ abl@@ e.
There are eff@@ ec@@ ts that you can con@@ tro@@ l li@@ ve, like re@@ ver@@ b and f@@ il@@ ter.
You at@@ ta@@ ch it to a par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar so@@ und and then ti@@ l@@ t to ad@@ just it.
And th@@ en, o@@ ver@@ all eff@@ ec@@ ts like tem@@ p@@ o and vol@@ um@@ e that ap@@ pl@@ y to the enti@@ re se@@ qu@@ enc@@ e.
So l@@ et's have a loo@@ k.
V@@ ide@@ o@@ : D@@ M@@ : We@@ 'll start by p@@ ut@@ ting a le@@ ad into two se@@ qu@@ ence Si@@ ft@@ abl@@ es, ar@@ r@@ ang@@ e them into a ser@@ i@@ es, ex@@ ten@@ d it, ad@@ d a little more le@@ a@@ d.
Now I put a bas@@ s l@@ ine in.
V@@ ide@@ o@@ : D@@ M@@ : Now I'@@ ll put some perc@@ us@@ sion in.
V@@ ide@@ o@@ : D@@ M@@ : And now I'@@ ll at@@ ta@@ ch the f@@ il@@ ter to the dr@@ um@@ s, so I can con@@ tro@@ l the eff@@ ect li@@ ve.
V@@ ide@@ o@@ : D@@ M@@ : I can spe@@ ed up the whole se@@ qu@@ ence by ti@@ l@@ ting the tem@@ p@@ o one way or the other@@ .
V@@ ide@@ o@@ : D@@ M@@ : And now I'@@ ll at@@ ta@@ ch the f@@ il@@ ter to the bas@@ s for some more ex@@ pres@@ si@@ on.
V@@ ide@@ o@@ : D@@ M@@ : I can re@@ ar@@ r@@ ang@@ e the se@@ qu@@ ence wh@@ ile it pla@@ y@@ s.
So I don't have to pl@@ an it out in ad@@ v@@ anc@@ e, but I can im@@ pro@@ vis@@ e, ma@@ king it l@@ on@@ ger or sh@@ or@@ ter as I go@@ .
And no@@ w, fin@@ ally, I can fa@@ de the whole se@@ qu@@ ence out us@@ ing the vol@@ um@@ e Si@@ ft@@ abl@@ e, ti@@ l@@ ted to the le@@ f@@ t.
Thank you.
So, as you can se@@ e, my passi@@ on is for ma@@ king new hum@@ an@@ -@@ comp@@ uter inter@@ fac@@ es that are a bet@@ ter mat@@ ch to the ways our bra@@ ins and bo@@ dies wor@@ k.
And to@@ da@@ y, I had time to show you one poin@@ t in this new des@@ ign spac@@ e, and a few of the possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ti@@ es that we're wor@@ king to br@@ ing out of the l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ y.
So the thought I want to le@@ a@@ ve you with is that we're on the c@@ us@@ p of this new gener@@ ation of to@@ ol@@ s for inter@@ ac@@ ting with dig@@ it@@ al me@@ di@@ a that are going to br@@ ing in@@ form@@ ation into our world on our ter@@ m@@ s.
Thank you very mu@@ ch.
I look for@@ war@@ d to tal@@ king with all of you.
I am a w@@ rit@@ er.
W@@ rit@@ ing bo@@ o@@ ks is my pro@@ f@@ es@@ sion but it's more than that, of cour@@ se.
It is also my great lif@@ el@@ ong lo@@ ve and fas@@ c@@ in@@ ation.
And I don't exp@@ ect that that's ever going to chang@@ e.
Bu@@ t, that said, something kind of p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar has happen@@ ed rec@@ ent@@ ly in my life and in my car@@ e@@ er, which has c@@ aus@@ ed me to have to rec@@ ali@@ br@@ ate my whole rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p with this wor@@ k.
And the p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar thing is that I rec@@ ent@@ ly w@@ ro@@ te this bo@@ o@@ k, this mem@@ o@@ ir called "@@ E@@ at@@ , P@@ ra@@ y, L@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ " wh@@ ich, de@@ ci@@ de@@ d@@ ly un@@ like any of my pre@@ vi@@ ous bo@@ ok@@ s, went out in the world for some reas@@ on, and bec@@ ame this b@@ ig@@ , me@@ ga@@ -@@ sen@@ s@@ ation, inter@@ n@@ ational bes@@ ts@@ ell@@ er thing@@ .
The res@@ ul@@ t of which is that every@@ where I go no@@ w, people tre@@ at me like I'm do@@ om@@ ed.
S@@ eri@@ ous@@ ly -- do@@ om@@ ed, do@@ om@@ ed@@ !
L@@ ik@@ e, they come up to me no@@ w, all wor@@ ri@@ ed, and they say, "@@ Ar@@ en@@ 't you af@@ ra@@ i@@ d you're never going to be able to to@@ p that@@ ?
Ar@@ en@@ 't you af@@ ra@@ i@@ d you're going to ke@@ ep w@@ rit@@ ing for your whole life and you're never ag@@ a@@ in going to cre@@ ate a bo@@ ok that any@@ body in the world car@@ es about at all@@ , ever again@@ ?"
So that's re@@ ass@@ ur@@ ing, you kno@@ w.
But it would be wor@@ se, ex@@ c@@ ep@@ t for that I happ@@ en to re@@ mem@@ ber that over 20 years ag@@ o, when I was a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er, when I first started tell@@ ing people that I wanted to be a w@@ rit@@ er, I was me@@ t with this same sort of f@@ ear@@ -@@ bas@@ ed re@@ ac@@ tion.
And people would say, "@@ Ar@@ en@@ 't you af@@ ra@@ i@@ d you're never going to have any su@@ c@@ c@@ ess@@ ?
Ar@@ en@@ 't you af@@ ra@@ i@@ d the hum@@ ili@@ ation of re@@ jec@@ tion will k@@ ill you@@ ?
Ar@@ en@@ 't you af@@ ra@@ i@@ d that you're going to work your whole life at this c@@ ra@@ ft and no@@ thing@@ 's ever going to come of it and you're going to die on a sc@@ ra@@ p he@@ a@@ p of b@@ ro@@ ken dre@@ am@@ s with your m@@ ou@@ th f@@ ill@@ ed with b@@ it@@ ter as@@ h of fa@@ il@@ u@@ re@@ ?"
Li@@ ke that, you kno@@ w.
The ans@@ wer -- the sh@@ ort ans@@ wer to all those ques@@ tions is, "@@ Y@@ es@@ ."
Y@@ es, I'm af@@ ra@@ i@@ d of all those thing@@ s.
And I al@@ ways have be@@ en.
And I'm af@@ ra@@ i@@ d of man@@ y, many more things bes@@ i@@ des that people can't even gu@@ ess at@@ , like se@@ a@@ we@@ ed and other things that are sc@@ ar@@ y.
Bu@@ t, when it comes to w@@ rit@@ ing, the thing that I've been sort of thin@@ king about lat@@ el@@ y, and w@@ onder@@ ing about lat@@ el@@ y, is wh@@ y@@ ?
You know, is it r@@ ation@@ al@@ ?
I@@ s it lo@@ g@@ ical that any@@ body should be exp@@ ec@@ ted to be af@@ ra@@ i@@ d of the work that they fe@@ el they were put on this E@@ ar@@ th to do@@ .
And what is it spec@@ if@@ ic@@ ally about cre@@ ative v@@ ent@@ ur@@ es that se@@ em@@ s to make us really n@@ er@@ v@@ ous about each other@@ 's ment@@ al he@@ al@@ th in a way that other car@@ e@@ ers kind of don't do@@ , you kno@@ w@@ ?
Li@@ ke my da@@ d, for exam@@ pl@@ e, was a ch@@ em@@ ical eng@@ in@@ e@@ er and I don't rec@@ all on@@ ce in his 4@@ 0 years of ch@@ em@@ ical eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing any@@ body as@@ king hi@@ m if he was af@@ ra@@ i@@ d to be a ch@@ em@@ ical eng@@ in@@ e@@ er, you kno@@ w@@ ?
"@@ That ch@@ em@@ ic@@ al@@ -@@ eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing b@@ lo@@ ck@@ , J@@ oh@@ n, ho@@ w@@ 's it go@@ ing@@ ?"
It just didn't come up like that, you kno@@ w@@ ?
But to be fa@@ ir@@ , ch@@ em@@ ical eng@@ in@@ e@@ ers as a gr@@ ou@@ p ha@@ ven@@ 't really ear@@ n@@ ed a re@@ p@@ ut@@ ation over the cent@@ u@@ ri@@ es for being al@@ co@@ ho@@ li@@ c man@@ ic@@ -@@ de@@ pres@@ si@@ v@@ es.
We w@@ rit@@ er@@ s, we kind of do have that re@@ p@@ ut@@ ation, and not just w@@ rit@@ er@@ s, but cre@@ ative people ac@@ ros@@ s all gen@@ r@@ es, it se@@ em@@ s, have this re@@ p@@ ut@@ ation for being en@@ or@@ m@@ ous@@ ly ment@@ ally un@@ st@@ abl@@ e.
And all you have to do is look at the very g@@ ri@@ m de@@ at@@ h coun@@ t in the 20@@ th cent@@ ur@@ y al@@ on@@ e, of really mag@@ n@@ if@@ ic@@ ent cre@@ ative min@@ ds who di@@ ed y@@ o@@ ung and of@@ ten at their own h@@ and@@ s, you kno@@ w@@ ?
And even the on@@ es who didn't li@@ ter@@ ally com@@ mit su@@ ic@@ i@@ de se@@ em to be really und@@ one by their gi@@ ft@@ s, you kno@@ w.
N@@ or@@ man Ma@@ il@@ er, just befor@@ e he di@@ ed, last inter@@ vie@@ w, he said, "@@ E@@ very one of my bo@@ o@@ ks has k@@ ill@@ ed me a little mor@@ e@@ ."
A@@ n ex@@ tra@@ ord@@ in@@ ary stat@@ em@@ ent to make about your lif@@ e's wor@@ k.
But we don't even bl@@ in@@ k when we he@@ ar som@@ eb@@ o@@ dy say this, because we've hear@@ d that kind of stu@@ f@@ f for so long and som@@ eh@@ o@@ w we've compl@@ et@@ ely inter@@ n@@ al@@ iz@@ ed and acc@@ ep@@ ted col@@ le@@ c@@ tiv@@ ely this no@@ tion that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity and su@@ ffer@@ ing are som@@ eh@@ o@@ w in@@ her@@ ent@@ ly lin@@ ked and that ar@@ ti@@ str@@ y, in the en@@ d, will al@@ ways ul@@ tim@@ at@@ ely le@@ ad to ang@@ u@@ is@@ h@@ .
And the ques@@ tion that I want to as@@ k every@@ body here to@@ day is are you gu@@ ys all co@@ o@@ l with that ide@@ a@@ ?
A@@ re you com@@ for@@ t@@ able with that@@ ?
Because you look at it even from an in@@ ch a@@ way and, you know -- I'm not at all com@@ for@@ t@@ able with that ass@@ um@@ p@@ tion.
I think it's o@@ di@@ ou@@ s.
And I also think it's d@@ ang@@ er@@ ou@@ s, and I don't want to see it per@@ p@@ et@@ u@@ ated into the next cent@@ ur@@ y.
I think it's bet@@ ter if we enc@@ our@@ age our great cre@@ ative min@@ ds to li@@ ve.
And I de@@ fin@@ it@@ ely know that, in my c@@ ase -- in my s@@ itu@@ ation -- it would be very d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous for me to start sort of le@@ a@@ king down that dar@@ k p@@ at@@ h of ass@@ um@@ p@@ tion, par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly gi@@ ven the c@@ ir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ ance that I'm in right now in my car@@ e@@ er.
Wh@@ ich is -- you know, like ch@@ ec@@ k it ou@@ t, I'm pre@@ tt@@ y y@@ o@@ ung@@ , I'm only about 4@@ 0 years ol@@ d.
I still have ma@@ y@@ be another f@@ our de@@ c@@ a@@ des of work le@@ ft in m@@ e.
And it's ex@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ ing@@ ly lik@@ ely that any@@ thing I w@@ rit@@ e from this poin@@ t for@@ war@@ d is going to be j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ed by the world as the work that came after the fre@@ ak@@ is@@ h su@@ c@@ c@@ ess of my last bo@@ o@@ k, righ@@ t?
I should just put it bl@@ un@@ tl@@ y, because we're all sort of fri@@ en@@ ds here now -- it's ex@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ ing@@ ly lik@@ ely that my gre@@ at@@ est su@@ c@@ c@@ ess is beh@@ ind m@@ e.
So J@@ es@@ us@@ , what a thou@@ gh@@ t@@ !
That's the kind of thought that could le@@ ad a per@@ son to start dr@@ in@@ king g@@ in at n@@ ine o@@ '@@ c@@ lo@@ ck in the mor@@ n@@ ing, and I don't want to go there.
I would pre@@ f@@ er to ke@@ ep doing this work that I lo@@ ve.
And so, the ques@@ tion be@@ com@@ es, ho@@ w@@ ?
And so, it se@@ em@@ s to me, up@@ on a lot of re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ tion, that the way that I have to work no@@ w, in or@@ der to con@@ tin@@ u@@ e w@@ rit@@ ing, is that I have to cre@@ ate some sort of pro@@ t@@ ec@@ tive p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ical con@@ stru@@ c@@ t, righ@@ t?
I have to sort of find some way to have a sa@@ fe di@@ st@@ ance between me, as I am w@@ rit@@ ing, and my very nat@@ ur@@ al an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y about what the re@@ ac@@ tion to that w@@ rit@@ ing is going to b@@ e, from now on.
An@@ d, as I've been loo@@ k@@ ing, over the last year@@ , for mo@@ del@@ s for how to do that, I've been sort of looking ac@@ ros@@ s time, and I've been tr@@ ying to find other so@@ c@@ ie@@ ti@@ es to see if they might have had bet@@ ter and s@@ an@@ er ide@@ as than we have about how to hel@@ p cre@@ ative people sort of man@@ age the in@@ her@@ ent em@@ o@@ tion@@ al ris@@ ks of cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity.
And that se@@ ar@@ ch has l@@ ed me to an@@ ci@@ ent G@@ re@@ ec@@ e and an@@ ci@@ ent R@@ om@@ e.
So st@@ a@@ y with me, because it does c@@ ir@@ c@@ le around and bac@@ k.
Bu@@ t, an@@ ci@@ ent G@@ re@@ ec@@ e and an@@ ci@@ ent R@@ ome -- people did not happ@@ en to belie@@ ve that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity came from human bein@@ g@@ s back th@@ en, OK@@ ?
P@@ e@@ o@@ ple belie@@ ved that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity was this di@@ v@@ ine at@@ ten@@ d@@ ant sp@@ ir@@ it that came to human bein@@ g@@ s from some di@@ st@@ ant and un@@ kno@@ w@@ able s@@ our@@ c@@ e, for di@@ st@@ ant and un@@ kno@@ w@@ able reas@@ on@@ s.
The G@@ re@@ ek@@ s fam@@ ous@@ ly called these di@@ v@@ ine at@@ ten@@ d@@ ant sp@@ ir@@ its of cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity "@@ da@@ em@@ on@@ s@@ ."
S@@ oc@@ rat@@ es, fam@@ ous@@ ly, belie@@ ved that he had a da@@ em@@ on who sp@@ o@@ ke wis@@ do@@ m to hi@@ m from af@@ ar@@ .
The R@@ om@@ ans had the same ide@@ a, but they called that sort of dis@@ em@@ bo@@ di@@ ed cre@@ ative sp@@ ir@@ it a gen@@ i@@ us@@ .
Wh@@ ich is gre@@ at@@ , because the R@@ om@@ ans did not actually think that a gen@@ i@@ us was a par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly c@@ le@@ ver in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al.
They belie@@ ved that a gen@@ i@@ us was this, sort of mag@@ ical di@@ v@@ ine ent@@ ity, who was belie@@ ved to li@@ ter@@ ally li@@ ve in the w@@ all@@ s of an ar@@ ti@@ st@@ 's stu@@ di@@ o, kind of like D@@ ob@@ by the h@@ ou@@ se el@@ f@@ , and sort of inv@@ is@@ i@@ b@@ ly ass@@ ist the ar@@ t@@ ist with their work and would s@@ ha@@ pe the ou@@ t@@ come of that wor@@ k.
So bri@@ lli@@ ant -- there it is, right ther@@ e, that di@@ st@@ ance that I'm tal@@ king about -- that p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ical con@@ stru@@ c@@ t to pro@@ t@@ ect you from the res@@ ul@@ ts of your wor@@ k.
And every@@ one k@@ new that this is how it f@@ un@@ c@@ tion@@ ed, righ@@ t?
So the an@@ ci@@ ent ar@@ t@@ ist was pro@@ t@@ ec@@ ted from cer@@ ta@@ in thing@@ s, lik@@ e, for exam@@ pl@@ e, to@@ o much n@@ ar@@ c@@ is@@ s@@ is@@ m, righ@@ t?
If your work was bri@@ lli@@ an@@ t, you c@@ oul@@ dn't take all the cre@@ di@@ t for it, every@@ body k@@ new that you had this dis@@ em@@ bo@@ di@@ ed gen@@ i@@ us who had hel@@ p@@ ed you.
If your work b@@ om@@ be@@ d, not enti@@ r@@ ely your f@@ au@@ l@@ t, you kno@@ w@@ ?
E@@ ver@@ y@@ one k@@ new your gen@@ i@@ us was kind of l@@ am@@ e.
And this is how people thought about cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity in the W@@ est for a really long time.
And then the R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came and every@@ thing ch@@ an@@ ge@@ d, and we had this big ide@@ a, and the big idea was, l@@ et's put the in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al human being at the cent@@ er of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se ab@@ o@@ ve all go@@ ds and m@@ y@@ st@@ eri@@ es, and there's no more ro@@ om for m@@ y@@ st@@ ical cre@@ at@@ ur@@ es who take dic@@ t@@ ation from the di@@ v@@ in@@ e.
And it's the beg@@ inn@@ ing of r@@ ational hum@@ an@@ is@@ m, and people started to belie@@ ve that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity came compl@@ et@@ ely from the sel@@ f of the in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al.
And for the first time in h@@ ist@@ or@@ y, you start to he@@ ar people re@@ fer@@ r@@ ing to this or that ar@@ t@@ ist as being a gen@@ i@@ us@@ , ra@@ ther than ha@@ ving a gen@@ i@@ us@@ .
And I got to tell you@@ , I think that was a h@@ u@@ ge err@@ or@@ .
You know, I think that all@@ o@@ wing som@@ eb@@ o@@ d@@ y, one m@@ ere per@@ son to belie@@ ve that he or she is lik@@ e, the v@@ es@@ sel@@ , you know, like the f@@ on@@ t and the ess@@ ence and the s@@ our@@ ce of all di@@ v@@ in@@ e, cre@@ ati@@ ve, un@@ kno@@ w@@ abl@@ e, et@@ ern@@ al m@@ y@@ ster@@ y is just a sm@@ id@@ ge to@@ o much res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ty to put on one frag@@ il@@ e, human p@@ sy@@ ch@@ e.
It's like as@@ king som@@ eb@@ o@@ dy to s@@ w@@ all@@ o@@ w the s@@ un@@ .
It just compl@@ et@@ ely war@@ ps and di@@ stor@@ ts e@@ go@@ s, and it cre@@ at@@ es all these un@@ man@@ ag@@ e@@ able exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations about per@@ for@@ man@@ c@@ e.
And I think the pres@@ s@@ ure of that has been k@@ ill@@ ing off our ar@@ ti@@ st@@ s for the last 5@@ 00 year@@ s.
An@@ d, if this is tru@@ e, and I think it is tru@@ e, the ques@@ tion be@@ com@@ es, what no@@ w@@ ?
C@@ an we do this differ@@ ent@@ l@@ y@@ ?
Ma@@ y@@ be go back to some more an@@ ci@@ ent under@@ stand@@ ing about the rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p between hum@@ ans and the cre@@ ative m@@ y@@ ster@@ y.
Ma@@ y@@ be no@@ t.
Ma@@ y@@ be we can't just er@@ ase 5@@ 00 years of r@@ ational hum@@ an@@ ist@@ ic thought in one 1@@ 8 min@@ u@@ te spe@@ e@@ ch.
And there's pro@@ bab@@ ly people in this au@@ di@@ ence who would ra@@ is@@ e really leg@@ it@@ im@@ ate sci@@ enti@@ f@@ ic s@@ us@@ pic@@ i@@ ons about the no@@ tion of@@ , bas@@ ic@@ ally, fa@@ i@@ ri@@ es who fol@@ lo@@ w people around ru@@ b@@ b@@ ing fa@@ ir@@ y j@@ u@@ ice on their pro@@ jec@@ ts and stu@@ ff@@ .
I'm no@@ t, pro@@ bab@@ ly, going to br@@ ing you all al@@ ong with me on this.
But the ques@@ tion that I kind of want to po@@ se is -- you know, why no@@ t?
Wh@@ y not think about it this wa@@ y@@ ?
Because it ma@@ kes as much sen@@ se as any@@ thing el@@ se I have ever hear@@ d in ter@@ m@@ s of ex@@ pl@@ ain@@ ing the ut@@ ter ma@@ d@@ den@@ ing cap@@ ri@@ ci@@ ous@@ n@@ ess of the cre@@ ative pro@@ c@@ es@@ s.
A pro@@ c@@ ess wh@@ ich, as any@@ body who has ever tri@@ ed to make something -- which is to say bas@@ ic@@ ally every@@ one here -@@ -- kno@@ ws does not al@@ ways beh@@ a@@ ve r@@ ation@@ all@@ y.
An@@ d, in fac@@ t, can some@@ tim@@ es fe@@ el do@@ w@@ n@@ right par@@ an@@ or@@ m@@ al.
I had this en@@ coun@@ ter rec@@ ent@@ ly where I me@@ t the ex@@ tra@@ ord@@ in@@ ary Americ@@ an po@@ et R@@ ut@@ h St@@ on@@ e, wh@@ o@@ 's now in her 9@@ 0@@ s, but sh@@ e's been a po@@ et her enti@@ re life and she t@@ old me that when she was gro@@ wing up in r@@ ur@@ al V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ i@@ a, she would be out wor@@ king in the f@@ iel@@ d@@ s, and she said she would fe@@ el and he@@ ar a po@@ em com@@ ing at her from over the l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e.
And she said it was like a th@@ under@@ ous tra@@ in of a@@ ir@@ .
And it would come bar@@ rel@@ ing down at her over the l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e.
And she f@@ el@@ t it com@@ ing, because it would s@@ ha@@ ke the ear@@ th un@@ der her fe@@ et.
S@@ he k@@ new that she had only one thing to do at that poin@@ t, and that was to@@ , in her wor@@ d@@ s, "@@ ru@@ n like h@@ ell@@ ."
And she would ru@@ n like hel@@ l to the h@@ ou@@ se and she would be get@@ ting ch@@ as@@ ed by this po@@ em@@ , and the whole de@@ al was that she had to get to a pi@@ ec@@ e of p@@ ap@@ er and a p@@ en@@ ci@@ l f@@ ast en@@ ough so that when it th@@ under@@ ed through her@@ , she could col@@ le@@ c@@ t it and gra@@ b it on the p@@ ag@@ e.
And other tim@@ es she w@@ oul@@ dn't be f@@ ast en@@ ou@@ gh@@ , so sh@@ e@@ '@@ d be r@@ un@@ ning and r@@ un@@ n@@ ing, and she w@@ oul@@ dn't get to the h@@ ou@@ se and the po@@ em would bar@@ re@@ l through her and she would mis@@ s it and she said it would con@@ tin@@ u@@ e on ac@@ ros@@ s the l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e, loo@@ k@@ ing, as she put it "@@ for another po@@ et@@ ."
And then there were these tim@@ es -- this is the pi@@ ec@@ e I never for@@ got -- she said that there were m@@ om@@ ents where she would al@@ most mis@@ s it, righ@@ t?
So, sh@@ e's r@@ un@@ ning to the h@@ ou@@ se and sh@@ e's looking for the p@@ ap@@ er and the po@@ em pas@@ s@@ es through her@@ , and she gr@@ ab@@ s a p@@ en@@ ci@@ l just as it's going through her@@ , and then she said, it was like she would re@@ ach out with her other h@@ and and she would c@@ at@@ ch it.
S@@ he would c@@ at@@ ch the po@@ em by its ta@@ il@@ , and she would pul@@ l it bac@@ k@@ war@@ ds into her body as she was tr@@ an@@ sc@@ ri@@ b@@ ing on the p@@ ag@@ e.
And in these in@@ st@@ anc@@ es, the po@@ em would come up on the p@@ age per@@ f@@ ect and in@@ t@@ ac@@ t but bac@@ k@@ war@@ d@@ s, from the last wor@@ d to the fir@@ st.
So when I hear@@ d that I was like -- that's un@@ c@@ ann@@ y, that's ex@@ ac@@ t@@ ly what my cre@@ ative pro@@ c@@ ess is lik@@ e.
That's not at all what my cre@@ ative pro@@ c@@ ess is -- I'm not the pi@@ p@@ el@@ in@@ e@@ !
I'm a m@@ ul@@ e, and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every da@@ y, and s@@ we@@ at and l@@ ab@@ or and bar@@ re@@ l through it really a@@ w@@ k@@ war@@ d@@ l@@ y.
But even I@@ , in my mu@@ li@@ sh@@ n@@ es@@ s, even I have br@@ us@@ h@@ ed up again@@ st that thing@@ , at tim@@ es.
And I would imag@@ ine that a lot of you have to@@ o.
You know, even I have had work or ide@@ as come through me from a s@@ our@@ ce that I h@@ on@@ est@@ ly can@@ not i@@ den@@ ti@@ f@@ y.
And what is that thing@@ ?
And how are we to rel@@ ate to it in a way that will not make us lo@@ se our min@@ d@@ s, bu@@ t, in fac@@ t, might actually ke@@ ep us s@@ an@@ e?
And for me, the bes@@ t con@@ tem@@ p@@ or@@ ary exam@@ ple that I have of how to do that is the mus@@ ic@@ i@@ an T@@ om W@@ a@@ it@@ s, who I got to inter@@ vie@@ w se@@ ver@@ al years ag@@ o on a mag@@ az@@ ine ass@@ ign@@ men@@ t.
And we were tal@@ king about this, and you know, T@@ om@@ , for most of his lif@@ e, he was pre@@ tt@@ y much the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the tor@@ ment@@ ed con@@ tem@@ p@@ or@@ ary mo@@ dern ar@@ ti@@ st, tr@@ ying to con@@ tro@@ l and man@@ age and d@@ om@@ in@@ ate these sort of un@@ con@@ tro@@ ll@@ able cre@@ ative imp@@ ul@@ s@@ es that were to@@ t@@ ally inter@@ n@@ al@@ iz@@ ed.
But then he got ol@@ der@@ , he got c@@ al@@ m@@ er, and one day he was dri@@ ving down the fre@@ e@@ way in L@@ o@@ s An@@ gel@@ es, and this is when it all chang@@ ed for h@@ im@@ .
And h@@ e's spe@@ ed@@ ing al@@ ong@@ , and all of a su@@ d@@ den he hear@@ s this little frag@@ ment of m@@ el@@ o@@ d@@ y, that comes into his he@@ ad as in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation of@@ ten com@@ es, el@@ us@@ i@@ ve and t@@ an@@ tal@@ iz@@ ing, and he wan@@ ts it, it's g@@ or@@ ge@@ ou@@ s, and he l@@ ong@@ s for it, but he has no way to get it.
He doesn't have a pi@@ ec@@ e of pa@@ per@@ , or a p@@ enc@@ il@@ , or a ta@@ pe rec@@ or@@ der@@ .
So he star@@ ts to fe@@ el all of that old an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y start to ris@@ e in hi@@ m lik@@ e, "@@ I'm going to lo@@ se this thing@@ , and I'@@ ll be be ha@@ un@@ ted by this son@@ g for@@ ever@@ .
I'm not good en@@ ou@@ gh@@ , and I can't do it@@ ."
And in@@ ste@@ ad of p@@ an@@ ick@@ ing, he just st@@ op@@ pe@@ d.
He just sto@@ pp@@ ed that whole ment@@ al pro@@ c@@ ess and he did something compl@@ et@@ ely no@@ vel@@ .
He just loo@@ ked up at the sk@@ y, and he said, "@@ Ex@@ c@@ use me, can you not see that I'm dri@@ v@@ ing@@ ?"
"@@ D@@ o I look like I can w@@ rit@@ e down a son@@ g right no@@ w@@ ?
If you really want to ex@@ ist, come back at a more o@@ pp@@ ort@@ un@@ e m@@ om@@ ent when I can take c@@ are of you.
O@@ ther@@ wis@@ e, go bo@@ ther som@@ eb@@ o@@ dy el@@ se to@@ da@@ y.
G@@ o bo@@ ther Le@@ on@@ ar@@ d C@@ oh@@ en@@ ."
And his whole work pro@@ c@@ ess chang@@ ed after that.
No@@ t the wor@@ k, the work was still of@@ ten@@ tim@@ es as dar@@ k as ever@@ .
But the pro@@ c@@ es@@ s, and the he@@ av@@ y an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y around it was rel@@ eas@@ ed when he to@@ ok the gen@@ i@@ e, the gen@@ i@@ us out of hi@@ m where it was c@@ aus@@ ing no@@ thing but tr@@ ou@@ bl@@ e, and rel@@ eas@@ ed it back where it came fro@@ m, and real@@ iz@@ ed that this didn't have to be this inter@@ n@@ al@@ iz@@ ed, tor@@ ment@@ ed thing@@ .
It could be this p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar@@ , w@@ on@@ dr@@ ou@@ s, bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re c@@ oll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation, kind of con@@ vers@@ ation between T@@ om and the str@@ ang@@ e, ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al thing that was not qu@@ ite T@@ om@@ .
When I hear@@ d that stor@@ y, it started to shi@@ ft a little bit the way that I wor@@ ked to@@ o, and this idea al@@ read@@ y sa@@ ved me on@@ c@@ e.
It sa@@ ved me when I was in the m@@ id@@ d@@ le of w@@ rit@@ ing "@@ E@@ at@@ , P@@ ra@@ y, L@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ ," and I f@@ ell into one of those sort of p@@ its of des@@ pa@@ ir that we all f@@ all into when we're wor@@ king on something and it's not com@@ ing and you start to think this is going to be a dis@@ ast@@ er, the wor@@ st bo@@ ok ever w@@ rit@@ t@@ en.
No@@ t just b@@ a@@ d, but the wor@@ st bo@@ ok ever w@@ rit@@ t@@ en.
And I started to think I should just d@@ um@@ p this pro@@ jec@@ t.
But then I re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed T@@ om tal@@ king to the op@@ en a@@ ir and I tri@@ ed it.
So I just lif@@ ted my fac@@ e up from the man@@ us@@ c@@ rip@@ t and I di@@ rec@@ ted my comm@@ ents to an em@@ p@@ ty cor@@ n@@ er of the ro@@ om@@ .
And I said al@@ ou@@ d, "@@ L@@ ist@@ en you@@ , thing@@ , you and I bo@@ th know that if this bo@@ ok is@@ n't bri@@ lli@@ ant that is not enti@@ r@@ ely my f@@ au@@ l@@ t, righ@@ t?
Because you can see that I am p@@ ut@@ ting every@@ thing I have into this, I don't have any more than this.
If you want it to be bet@@ ter, you@@ 've got to show up and do your part of the de@@ al.
But if you don't do that, you know wh@@ at@@ , the hel@@ l with it.
I'm going to ke@@ ep w@@ rit@@ ing any@@ way because that's my j@@ ob@@ .
And I would pl@@ eas@@ e like the rec@@ or@@ d to re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ t to@@ day that I sho@@ w@@ ed up for my part of the j@@ ob@@ ."
Because -- Because in the end it's like this, O@@ K -- cent@@ u@@ ri@@ es ag@@ o in the des@@ er@@ ts of N@@ or@@ th Afric@@ a, people used to ga@@ ther for these mo@@ on@@ li@@ ght d@@ anc@@ es of s@@ ac@@ red d@@ ance and mus@@ ic that would go on for h@@ our@@ s and h@@ our@@ s, un@@ ti@@ l da@@ w@@ n.
They were al@@ ways mag@@ n@@ if@@ ic@@ ent, because the d@@ anc@@ ers were pro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ als and they were ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ic@@ , righ@@ t?
But every on@@ ce in a wh@@ il@@ e, very r@@ ar@@ el@@ y, something would happ@@ en, and one of these per@@ for@@ mer@@ s would actually be@@ come tr@@ an@@ sc@@ en@@ den@@ t.
And I know you know what I'm tal@@ king ab@@ ou@@ t, because I know you@@ 've all se@@ en, at some poin@@ t in your lif@@ e, a per@@ for@@ man@@ ce like this.
It was like time would st@@ op@@ , and the d@@ anc@@ er would sort of ste@@ p through some kind of p@@ ort@@ al and he was@@ n't doing any@@ thing different than he had ever don@@ e, 1@@ ,000 n@@ igh@@ ts befor@@ e, but every@@ thing would al@@ ign@@ .
And all of a su@@ d@@ den, he would no l@@ on@@ ger ap@@ pe@@ ar to be mer@@ ely hum@@ an.
He would be li@@ t from wi@@ thin@@ , and li@@ t from bel@@ o@@ w and all li@@ t up on fir@@ e with di@@ v@@ in@@ ity.
And when this happen@@ ed, back th@@ en, people k@@ new it for what it was, you know, they called it by its nam@@ e.
They would put their h@@ and@@ s toge@@ ther and they would start to ch@@ an@@ t, "@@ Al@@ l@@ ah@@ , Al@@ l@@ ah@@ , Al@@ l@@ ah@@ , Go@@ d, Go@@ d, Go@@ d@@ ."
That's Go@@ d, you kno@@ w.
C@@ u@@ ri@@ ous h@@ ist@@ or@@ ical foo@@ t@@ no@@ te@@ : when the Mo@@ or@@ s inv@@ ad@@ ed s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ pa@@ in, they to@@ ok this c@@ u@@ st@@ om with them and the pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation chang@@ ed over the cent@@ u@@ ri@@ es from "@@ Al@@ l@@ ah@@ , Al@@ l@@ ah@@ , Al@@ l@@ ah@@ ," to "@@ O@@ l@@ é@@ , ol@@ é@@ , ol@@ é@@ ," which you still he@@ ar in b@@ ul@@ l@@ f@@ igh@@ ts and in fl@@ am@@ enc@@ o d@@ anc@@ es.
In S@@ pa@@ in, when a per@@ form@@ er has d@@ one something im@@ possi@@ ble and mag@@ ic@@ , "@@ Al@@ l@@ ah@@ , ol@@ é@@ , ol@@ é@@ , Al@@ l@@ ah@@ , mag@@ n@@ if@@ ic@@ ent, bra@@ v@@ o@@ ," in@@ comp@@ re@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ bl@@ e, there it is -- a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of Go@@ d.
Wh@@ ich is gre@@ at@@ , because we need that.
Bu@@ t, the tri@@ ck@@ y bit comes the next mor@@ n@@ ing, for the d@@ anc@@ er h@@ im@@ self@@ , when he wa@@ kes up and dis@@ co@@ ver@@ s that it's T@@ u@@ es@@ day at 1@@ 1 a@@ .@@ m@@ .@@ , and h@@ e's no l@@ on@@ ger a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of Go@@ d.
H@@ e's just an ag@@ ing mor@@ t@@ al with really b@@ ad k@@ ne@@ es, and ma@@ y@@ be h@@ e's never going to as@@ c@@ end to that hei@@ ght again@@ .
And ma@@ y@@ be no@@ body will ever ch@@ ant Go@@ d@@ 's n@@ ame ag@@ a@@ in as he sp@@ in@@ s, and what is he then to do with the res@@ t of his li@@ fe@@ ?
This is har@@ d.
This is one of the most pa@@ in@@ ful re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ations to make in a cre@@ ative lif@@ e.
But ma@@ y@@ be it doesn't have to be qu@@ ite so ful@@ l of ang@@ u@@ is@@ h if you never happen@@ ed to belie@@ ve, in the first plac@@ e, that the most ex@@ tra@@ ord@@ in@@ ary as@@ p@@ ec@@ ts of your being came from you.
But ma@@ y@@ be if you just belie@@ ved that they were on lo@@ an to you from some un@@ imag@@ in@@ able s@@ our@@ ce for some ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite p@@ or@@ tion of your life to be pas@@ s@@ ed al@@ ong when you're fin@@ is@@ he@@ d, with som@@ eb@@ o@@ dy el@@ se.
An@@ d, you know, if we think about it this way, it star@@ ts to change every@@ thing@@ .
This is how I've started to thin@@ k, and this is cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly how I've been thin@@ king in the last few mon@@ th@@ s as I've been wor@@ king on the bo@@ ok that will so@@ on be p@@ ub@@ li@@ sh@@ ed, as the d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous@@ ly, fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing@@ ly o@@ ver@@ -@@ an@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated fol@@ lo@@ w up to my fre@@ ak@@ is@@ h su@@ c@@ c@@ es@@ s.
And what I have to sort of ke@@ ep tell@@ ing m@@ y@@ sel@@ f when I get really p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ed out about that is don't be af@@ ra@@ i@@ d.
D@@ on@@ 't be da@@ un@@ te@@ d. J@@ ust do your j@@ ob@@ .

J@@ un@@ e C@@ oh@@ en@@ : O@@ l@@ é@@ !
You know, I've tal@@ ked about some of these pro@@ jec@@ ts befor@@ e -- about the human gen@@ ome and what that might me@@ an, and dis@@ co@@ ver@@ ing new s@@ et@@ s of gen@@ es.
We@@ 're actually star@@ ting at a new poin@@ t: we've been dig@@ iti@@ z@@ ing bi@@ olog@@ y, and now we're tr@@ ying to go from that dig@@ it@@ al co@@ de into a new ph@@ ase of bi@@ olog@@ y with design@@ ing and sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ iz@@ ing lif@@ e.
So, we've al@@ ways been tr@@ ying to as@@ k big ques@@ tion@@ s.
"@@ What is li@@ fe@@ ?" is something that I think many bi@@ olog@@ ist@@ s have been tr@@ ying to under@@ stand at v@@ ari@@ ous le@@ vel@@ s.
We@@ 've tri@@ ed v@@ ari@@ ous ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es, par@@ ing it down to min@@ im@@ al comp@@ on@@ ent@@ s.
We@@ 've been dig@@ iti@@ z@@ ing it now for al@@ most 20 year@@ s@@ ; when we se@@ qu@@ enc@@ ed the human gen@@ om@@ e, it was going from the an@@ al@@ o@@ g world of bi@@ olog@@ y into the dig@@ it@@ al world of the comp@@ u@@ ter.
Now we're tr@@ ying to as@@ k, "@@ C@@ an we re@@ gener@@ ate life or can we cre@@ ate new life out of this dig@@ it@@ al un@@ i@@ ver@@ se@@ ?"
This is the ma@@ p of a sm@@ all organ@@ is@@ m, M@@ y@@ co@@ pl@@ as@@ m@@ a gen@@ it@@ ali@@ um@@ , that has the sm@@ all@@ est gen@@ ome for a spec@@ ies that can self@@ -@@ re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate in the l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ y, and we've been tr@@ ying to just see if we can come up with an even sm@@ all@@ er gen@@ om@@ e.
We@@ 're able to kno@@ ck out on the or@@ der of 100 gen@@ es out of the 5@@ 00 or so that are here.
When we look at its m@@ et@@ ab@@ o@@ li@@ c ma@@ p@@ , it's rel@@ ati@@ v@@ ely sim@@ ple com@@ par@@ ed to our@@ s -- tr@@ ust me, this is sim@@ ple -- but when we look at all the gen@@ es that we can kno@@ ck out one at a time, it's very un@@ lik@@ ely that this would y@@ iel@@ d a li@@ ving c@@ ell@@ .
So we de@@ ci@@ ded the only way for@@ war@@ d was to actually sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ iz@@ e this ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some so we could v@@ ary the comp@@ on@@ ents to as@@ k some of these most f@@ und@@ am@@ ent@@ al ques@@ tion@@ s.
And so we started down the ro@@ ad of@@ : can we sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ iz@@ e a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some@@ ?
C@@ an ch@@ em@@ ist@@ ry per@@ mit ma@@ king these really lar@@ ge m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ es where we've never been befor@@ e?
And if we do@@ , can we bo@@ o@@ t up a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some@@ ?
A ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ e, by the way, is just a pi@@ ec@@ e of in@@ ert ch@@ em@@ ical mat@@ eri@@ al.
So, our p@@ ac@@ e of dig@@ iti@@ z@@ ing life has been incre@@ as@@ ing at an exp@@ on@@ enti@@ al p@@ ac@@ e.
O@@ ur ab@@ ili@@ ty to w@@ rit@@ e the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c co@@ de has been mo@@ ving pre@@ tt@@ y s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly but has been incre@@ as@@ ing, and our lat@@ est poin@@ t would put it on, no@@ w, an exp@@ on@@ enti@@ al c@@ ur@@ ve.
We started this over 1@@ 5 years ag@@ o.
It to@@ ok se@@ ver@@ al st@@ ag@@ es, in fac@@ t, star@@ ting with a bi@@ o@@ e@@ th@@ ical re@@ vie@@ w befor@@ e we did the first exper@@ im@@ ent@@ s.
But it tur@@ n@@ s out sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ iz@@ ing D@@ N@@ A is very di@@ ff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t.
There are ten@@ s of thou@@ s@@ and@@ s of mach@@ in@@ es around the world that make sm@@ all pi@@ ec@@ es of D@@ N@@ A -- 3@@ 0 to 50 l@@ et@@ ter@@ s in l@@ eng@@ th -- and it's a de@@ gener@@ ate pro@@ c@@ es@@ s, so the l@@ on@@ ger you make the pi@@ ec@@ e, the more err@@ or@@ s there ar@@ e.
So we had to cre@@ ate a new me@@ tho@@ d for p@@ ut@@ ting these little pi@@ ec@@ es toge@@ ther and cor@@ rec@@ t all the err@@ or@@ s.
And this was our first at@@ tem@@ p@@ t, star@@ ting with the dig@@ it@@ al in@@ form@@ ation of the gen@@ ome of ph@@ i X@@ 1@@ 7@@ 4@@ .
It's a sm@@ all vi@@ ru@@ s that k@@ ill@@ s bac@@ ter@@ i@@ a.
We design@@ ed the pi@@ ec@@ es, went through our er@@ ro@@ r cor@@ rec@@ tion and had a D@@ N@@ A m@@ ol@@ ec@@ u@@ le of about 5@@ ,000 l@@ et@@ ter@@ s.
The ex@@ c@@ it@@ ing ph@@ ase came when we to@@ ok this pi@@ ec@@ e of in@@ ert ch@@ em@@ ical and put it in the bac@@ ter@@ i@@ a, and the bac@@ ter@@ i@@ a started to re@@ ad this gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c co@@ de, made the vir@@ al par@@ tic@@ l@@ es.
The vir@@ al par@@ tic@@ les then were rel@@ eas@@ ed from the c@@ ell@@ s and came back and k@@ ill@@ ed the E@@ . co@@ li@@ .
I was tal@@ king to the o@@ il in@@ du@@ str@@ y rec@@ ent@@ ly and I said they c@@ lear@@ ly under@@ st@@ oo@@ d that mo@@ del@@ .
They l@@ au@@ gh@@ ed more than you gu@@ ys ar@@ e. And so, we think this is a s@@ itu@@ ation where the so@@ ft@@ w@@ are can actually bu@@ ild its own har@@ d@@ w@@ are in a bi@@ olog@@ ical system@@ .
But we wanted to go much lar@@ ger@@ : we wanted to bu@@ ild the enti@@ re bac@@ ter@@ i@@ al ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some -- it's over 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,000 l@@ et@@ ter@@ s of gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c co@@ de -- so we thought we@@ '@@ d bu@@ ild them in c@@ ass@@ et@@ tes the si@@ ze of the vir@@ us@@ es so we could actually v@@ ary the c@@ ass@@ et@@ tes to under@@ stand what the actu@@ al comp@@ on@@ ents of a li@@ ving c@@ ell ar@@ e.
Des@@ ign is c@@ rit@@ ic@@ al, and if you're star@@ ting with dig@@ it@@ al in@@ form@@ ation in the comp@@ u@@ ter, that dig@@ it@@ al in@@ form@@ ation has to be really acc@@ ur@@ at@@ e.
When we first se@@ qu@@ enc@@ ed this gen@@ ome in 19@@ 9@@ 5@@ , the stand@@ ar@@ d of acc@@ ur@@ ac@@ y was one er@@ ro@@ r per 1@@ 0@@ ,000 bas@@ e pa@@ ir@@ s.
We actually f@@ oun@@ d, on res@@ e@@ qu@@ enc@@ ing it, 3@@ 0 err@@ or@@ s@@ ; had we used that or@@ ig@@ in@@ al se@@ qu@@ enc@@ e, it never would have been able to be bo@@ o@@ ted up@@ .
Par@@ t of the des@@ ign is design@@ ing pi@@ ec@@ es that are 50 l@@ et@@ ter@@ s long that have to o@@ ver@@ la@@ p with all the other 5@@ 0@@ -@@ l@@ et@@ ter pi@@ ec@@ es to bu@@ ild sm@@ all@@ er sub@@ un@@ its we have to des@@ ign so they can go toge@@ ther@@ .
We des@@ ign un@@ i@@ qu@@ e el@@ em@@ ents into this.
You ma@@ y have re@@ ad that we put wat@@ er@@ mar@@ ks in.
Th@@ in@@ k of th@@ is@@ : we have a f@@ our@@ -@@ l@@ et@@ ter gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c co@@ de -- A@@ , C@@ , G and T@@ .
T@@ ri@@ pl@@ et@@ s of those l@@ et@@ ter@@ s co@@ de for r@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly 20 am@@ in@@ o ac@@ id@@ s, su@@ ch that there's a s@@ ing@@ le l@@ et@@ ter design@@ ation for each of the am@@ in@@ o ac@@ id@@ s.
So we can use the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c co@@ de to w@@ rit@@ e out wor@@ d@@ s, s@@ ent@@ enc@@ es, thou@@ gh@@ ts.
In@@ iti@@ ally, all we did was au@@ to@@ gra@@ p@@ h it.
S@@ ome people were dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted there was not po@@ et@@ r@@ y.
We design@@ ed these pi@@ ec@@ es so we can just ch@@ e@@ w back with enz@@ y@@ m@@ es@@ ; there are enz@@ y@@ m@@ es that re@@ pa@@ ir them and put them toge@@ ther@@ .
And we started ma@@ king pi@@ ec@@ es, star@@ ting with pi@@ ec@@ es that were 5@@ ,000 to 7@@ ,000 l@@ et@@ ter@@ s, put those toge@@ ther to make 2@@ 4@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ -@@ l@@ et@@ ter pi@@ ec@@ es, then put s@@ et@@ s of those going up to 7@@ 2@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ .
A@@ t each st@@ ag@@ e, we gre@@ w up these pi@@ ec@@ es in ab@@ und@@ ance so we could se@@ qu@@ ence them because we're tr@@ ying to cre@@ ate a pro@@ c@@ ess that's ex@@ tre@@ m@@ ely ro@@ b@@ ust that you can see in a min@@ ut@@ e.
We@@ 're tr@@ ying to get to the poin@@ t of au@@ t@@ om@@ ation.
So, this loo@@ ks like a bas@@ k@@ et@@ b@@ all pla@@ y@@ off@@ .
When we get into these really lar@@ ge pi@@ ec@@ es over 1@@ 00@@ ,000 bas@@ e pa@@ ir@@ s, they w@@ on@@ 't any l@@ on@@ ger gro@@ w re@@ a@@ di@@ ly in E@@ . col@@ i -- it ex@@ h@@ au@@ st@@ s all the mo@@ dern to@@ ol@@ s of m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ ar bi@@ olog@@ y -- and so we tur@@ n@@ ed to other me@@ ch@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s.
We k@@ new there's a me@@ ch@@ an@@ is@@ m called h@@ om@@ olog@@ ous re@@ com@@ bin@@ ation that bi@@ olog@@ y us@@ es to re@@ pa@@ ir D@@ N@@ A that can put pi@@ ec@@ es toge@@ ther@@ .
Her@@ e's an exam@@ ple of it@@ : there's an organ@@ is@@ m called D@@ ein@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ c@@ us ra@@ di@@ o@@ dur@@ ans that can take three m@@ illi@@ ons ra@@ ds of ra@@ di@@ ation.
You can see in the to@@ p p@@ an@@ el@@ , its ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some just get@@ s b@@ lo@@ wn ap@@ ar@@ t.
T@@ wel@@ ve to 2@@ 4 h@@ our@@ s lat@@ er, it put it back toge@@ ther ex@@ ac@@ t@@ ly as it was befor@@ e.
We have thou@@ s@@ and@@ s of organ@@ is@@ m@@ s that can do this.
Th@@ ese organ@@ is@@ m@@ s can be to@@ t@@ ally des@@ ic@@ c@@ at@@ ed@@ ; they can li@@ ve in a v@@ ac@@ u@@ um@@ .
I am ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely cer@@ ta@@ in that life can ex@@ ist in ou@@ ter spac@@ e, mo@@ ve ar@@ oun@@ d, find a new a@@ qu@@ e@@ ous en@@ vir@@ on@@ men@@ t.
In fac@@ t, N@@ A@@ S@@ A has sho@@ wn a lot of this is out there.
Her@@ e's an actu@@ al m@@ ic@@ ro@@ gra@@ p@@ h of the m@@ ol@@ ec@@ u@@ le we bu@@ il@@ t us@@ ing these pro@@ c@@ ess@@ es, actually just us@@ ing ye@@ ast me@@ ch@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s with the right des@@ ign of the pi@@ ec@@ es we put them in@@ ; ye@@ ast p@@ ut@@ s them toge@@ ther au@@ t@@ om@@ ati@@ call@@ y.
This is not an el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on m@@ ic@@ ro@@ gra@@ ph@@ ; this is just a re@@ g@@ ul@@ ar p@@ ho@@ t@@ om@@ ic@@ ro@@ gra@@ ph@@ .
It's su@@ ch a lar@@ ge m@@ ol@@ ec@@ u@@ le we can see it with a li@@ ght m@@ ic@@ ros@@ co@@ p@@ e.
Th@@ ese are pic@@ tur@@ es over about a si@@ x@@ -@@ secon@@ d per@@ i@@ o@@ d.
So, this is the p@@ ub@@ lic@@ ation we had just a sh@@ ort wh@@ ile ag@@ o.
This is over 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,000 l@@ et@@ ter@@ s of gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c co@@ de@@ ; it's the lar@@ ges@@ t m@@ ol@@ ec@@ u@@ le ever made by hum@@ ans of a de@@ fin@@ ed stru@@ c@@ tu@@ re.
It's over 3@@ 00 million m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ ar wei@@ gh@@ t.
If we pr@@ in@@ ted it out at a 10 f@@ on@@ t with no spac@@ ing, it ta@@ kes 1@@ 4@@ 2 p@@ ag@@ es just to pr@@ in@@ t this gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c co@@ de.
Well, how do we bo@@ o@@ t up a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some@@ ? How do we ac@@ tiv@@ ate th@@ is@@ ?
O@@ b@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly, with a vi@@ ru@@ s it's pre@@ tt@@ y sim@@ pl@@ e@@ ; it's much more comp@@ lic@@ ated de@@ al@@ ing with bac@@ ter@@ i@@ a.
It's also sim@@ pl@@ er when you go into eu@@ k@@ ar@@ y@@ o@@ tes like our@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ : you can just po@@ p out the nu@@ c@@ le@@ us and po@@ p in another on@@ e, and that's what you@@ 've all hear@@ d about with c@@ l@@ on@@ ing.
W@@ it@@ h bac@@ ter@@ i@@ a and Ar@@ ch@@ a@@ e@@ a, the ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some is in@@ te@@ gr@@ ated into the c@@ ell, but we rec@@ ent@@ ly sho@@ w@@ ed that we can do a compl@@ ete trans@@ pl@@ ant of a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some from one c@@ ell to another and ac@@ tiv@@ ate it.
We p@@ u@@ ri@@ fi@@ ed a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some from one m@@ ic@@ ro@@ bi@@ al spec@@ ies -- r@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly, these two are as di@@ st@@ ant as human and m@@ ice -- we ad@@ ded a few ex@@ tr@@ a gen@@ es so we could sel@@ ect for this ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ e, we di@@ ges@@ ted it with enz@@ y@@ m@@ es to k@@ ill all the pro@@ t@@ ein@@ s, and it was pre@@ tt@@ y st@@ un@@ ning when we put this in the c@@ ell -- and you@@ 'll a@@ pp@@ re@@ ci@@ ate our very so@@ ph@@ ist@@ ic@@ ated gra@@ ph@@ ic@@ s here.
The new ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some went into the c@@ ell@@ .
In fac@@ t, we thought this might be as f@@ ar as it wen@@ t, but we tri@@ ed to des@@ ign the pro@@ c@@ ess a little bit f@@ ur@@ ther@@ .
This is a ma@@ j@@ or me@@ ch@@ an@@ is@@ m of evol@@ u@@ tion right here.
We find all k@@ in@@ ds of spec@@ ies that have ta@@ ken up a secon@@ d ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some or a th@@ ir@@ d one from some@@ wh@@ er@@ e, ad@@ ding thou@@ s@@ and@@ s of new tra@@ its in a secon@@ d to that spec@@ i@@ es.
So, people who think of evol@@ u@@ tion as just one gen@@ e chang@@ ing at a time have mis@@ s@@ ed much of bi@@ olog@@ y.
There are enz@@ y@@ m@@ es called res@@ tri@@ c@@ tion enz@@ y@@ m@@ es that actually di@@ ges@@ t D@@ N@@ A@@ .
The ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some that was in the c@@ ell doesn't have on@@ e@@ ; the ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some we put in do@@ es.
It got ex@@ pres@@ s@@ ed and it re@@ co@@ g@@ n@@ iz@@ ed the other ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some as for@@ eig@@ n mat@@ eri@@ al, ch@@ e@@ w@@ ed it up@@ , and so we end@@ ed up just with a c@@ ell with the new ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ e.
It tur@@ n@@ ed bl@@ u@@ e because of the gen@@ es we put in it.
And with a very sh@@ ort per@@ i@@ od of time, all the ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ ist@@ ic@@ s of one spec@@ ies were lo@@ st and it con@@ ver@@ ted to@@ t@@ ally into the new spec@@ ies bas@@ ed on the new so@@ ft@@ w@@ are that we put in the c@@ ell@@ .
Al@@ l the pro@@ t@@ ein@@ s ch@@ an@@ ge@@ d, the mem@@ br@@ an@@ es ch@@ an@@ ge@@ d@@ ; when we re@@ ad the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c co@@ de, it's ex@@ ac@@ t@@ ly what we had trans@@ fer@@ red in.
So, this ma@@ y so@@ und like gen@@ om@@ ic al@@ ch@@ em@@ y, but we c@@ an, by mo@@ ving the so@@ ft@@ w@@ are of D@@ N@@ A ar@@ oun@@ d, change things qu@@ ite dr@@ am@@ ati@@ call@@ y.
Now I've ar@@ gu@@ ed, this is not gen@@ es@@ is@@ ; this is build@@ ing on three and a hal@@ f b@@ illion years of evol@@ u@@ tion.
And I've ar@@ gu@@ ed that we're about to per@@ ha@@ ps cre@@ ate a new ver@@ sion of the C@@ am@@ bri@@ an ex@@ pl@@ o@@ si@@ on, where there's m@@ as@@ si@@ ve new spec@@ i@@ ation bas@@ ed on this dig@@ it@@ al design@@ .
Wh@@ y do th@@ is@@ ?
I think this is pre@@ tt@@ y ob@@ vi@@ ous in ter@@ m@@ s of some of the ne@@ ed@@ s.
We@@ 're about to go from si@@ x and a hal@@ f to n@@ ine b@@ illion people over the next 4@@ 0 year@@ s.
T@@ o put it in con@@ t@@ ex@@ t for m@@ y@@ self@@ : I was b@@ or@@ n in 19@@ 4@@ 6@@ .
There are now three people on the plan@@ et for every one of us that ex@@ ist@@ ed in 19@@ 4@@ 6@@ ; with@@ in 4@@ 0 year@@ s, ther@@ e@@ 'll be f@@ our@@ .
We have tr@@ ou@@ ble fe@@ ed@@ ing, pro@@ vi@@ ding f@@ res@@ h, c@@ le@@ an wat@@ er, me@@ dic@@ in@@ es, fu@@ el for the si@@ x and a hal@@ f b@@ illi@@ on.
It's going to be a st@@ re@@ t@@ ch to do it for n@@ in@@ e.
We use over fi@@ ve b@@ illion t@@ ons of co@@ al, 3@@ 0 b@@ illi@@ on@@ -@@ pl@@ us bar@@ rel@@ s of o@@ il -- that's a h@@ und@@ red million bar@@ rel@@ s a da@@ y.
When we try to think of bi@@ olog@@ ical pro@@ c@@ ess@@ es or any pro@@ c@@ ess to re@@ plac@@ e that, it's going to be a h@@ u@@ ge ch@@ all@@ eng@@ e.
Th@@ en of cour@@ se, there's all that C@@ O@@ 2 from this mat@@ eri@@ al that en@@ ds up in the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here.
We no@@ w, from our dis@@ co@@ very around the worl@@ d, have a dat@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 million gen@@ es, and I like to think of these as the des@@ ign comp@@ on@@ ents of the f@@ ut@@ u@@ re.
The el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic@@ s in@@ du@@ str@@ y only had a do@@ zen or so comp@@ on@@ ent@@ s, and look at the di@@ vers@@ ity that came out of that.
We@@ 're li@@ mit@@ ed here pri@@ mar@@ il@@ y by a bi@@ olog@@ ical real@@ ity and our imag@@ in@@ ation.
We now have techn@@ i@@ qu@@ es, because of these ra@@ pi@@ d me@@ tho@@ ds of sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ is, to do what we're call@@ ing com@@ bin@@ at@@ ori@@ al gen@@ om@@ ic@@ s.
We have the ab@@ ili@@ ty now to bu@@ ild a lar@@ ge ro@@ bo@@ t that can make a million ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es a da@@ y.
When you think of pro@@ c@@ ess@@ ing these 20 million different gen@@ es or tr@@ ying to op@@ tim@@ iz@@ e pro@@ c@@ ess@@ es to pro@@ du@@ ce oc@@ t@@ an@@ e or to pro@@ du@@ ce ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ eu@@ tic@@ al@@ s, new v@@ acc@@ in@@ es, we can just with a sm@@ all te@@ am@@ , do more m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ ar bi@@ olog@@ y than the last 20 years of all sci@@ enc@@ e.
And it's just stand@@ ar@@ d sel@@ ec@@ tion@@ : we can sel@@ ect for vi@@ ab@@ ili@@ t@@ y, ch@@ em@@ ical or fu@@ el produc@@ tion, v@@ acc@@ ine produc@@ tion, et@@ c@@ .
This is a s@@ cre@@ en s@@ n@@ ap@@ sho@@ t of some tru@@ e des@@ ign so@@ ft@@ w@@ are that we're wor@@ king on to actually be able to s@@ it down and des@@ ign spec@@ ies in the comp@@ u@@ ter.
You know, we don't know nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ il@@ y what it@@ 'll look lik@@ e: we know ex@@ ac@@ t@@ ly what their gen@@ e@@ ti@@ c co@@ de loo@@ ks lik@@ e.
We@@ 're f@@ oc@@ us@@ ing on now f@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ gener@@ ation fu@@ el@@ s.
Y@@ ou@@ 've se@@ en rec@@ ent@@ ly, cor@@ n to e@@ th@@ an@@ o@@ l is just a b@@ ad exper@@ im@@ ent.
We have secon@@ d@@ - and th@@ ir@@ d@@ -@@ gener@@ ation fu@@ el@@ s that will be com@@ ing out rel@@ ati@@ v@@ ely so@@ on that are su@@ g@@ ar@@ , to much h@@ ig@@ her@@ -@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ e fu@@ el@@ s like oc@@ t@@ an@@ e or different ty@@ p@@ es of b@@ ut@@ an@@ ol@@ .
But the only way we think that bi@@ olog@@ y can have a ma@@ j@@ or imp@@ ac@@ t with@@ out f@@ ur@@ ther incre@@ as@@ ing the co@@ st of foo@@ d and li@@ mit@@ ing its av@@ a@@ il@@ ab@@ ili@@ ty is if we start with C@@ O@@ 2 as its fe@@ ed@@ sto@@ ck@@ , and so we're wor@@ king with design@@ ing c@@ ell@@ s to go down this ro@@ a@@ d.
And we think we@@ 'll have the first f@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ gener@@ ation fu@@ el@@ s in about 1@@ 8 mon@@ th@@ s.
S@@ un@@ li@@ ght and C@@ O@@ 2 is one me@@ tho@@ d ...
but in our dis@@ co@@ very around the worl@@ d, we have all k@@ in@@ ds of other me@@ tho@@ d@@ s.
This is an organ@@ is@@ m we des@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ed in 19@@ 9@@ 6@@ .
It li@@ ves in the de@@ ep oc@@ e@@ an, about a m@@ ile and a hal@@ f de@@ ep@@ , al@@ most at bo@@ il@@ ing@@ -@@ wat@@ er tem@@ per@@ at@@ ur@@ es.
It ta@@ kes C@@ O@@ 2 to me@@ th@@ an@@ e us@@ ing m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ ar h@@ y@@ dro@@ gen as its energ@@ y s@@ our@@ c@@ e.
We@@ 're looking to see if we can take cap@@ tu@@ red C@@ O@@ 2@@ , which can eas@@ il@@ y be pi@@ p@@ ed to sit@@ es, con@@ ver@@ t that C@@ O@@ 2 back into fu@@ el to dri@@ ve this pro@@ c@@ es@@ s.
So, in a sh@@ ort per@@ i@@ od of time, we think that we might be able to incre@@ ase what the bas@@ ic ques@@ tion is of "@@ What is li@@ fe@@ ?"
We tr@@ ul@@ y, you know, have mo@@ des@@ t go@@ als of re@@ plac@@ ing the whole p@@ et@@ ro@@ l@@ -@@ ch@@ em@@ ical in@@ du@@ str@@ y -- Y@@ e@@ ah@@ . If you can't do that at TE@@ D@@ , where can you@@ ? -- be@@ come a ma@@ j@@ or s@@ our@@ ce of energ@@ y ...
But al@@ so, we're now wor@@ king on us@@ ing these same to@@ ol@@ s to come up with in@@ st@@ ant s@@ et@@ s of v@@ acc@@ in@@ es.
Y@@ ou@@ 've se@@ en this ye@@ ar with fl@@ u@@ ; we're al@@ ways a ye@@ ar beh@@ ind and a d@@ oll@@ ar sh@@ ort when it comes to the right v@@ acc@@ in@@ e.
I think that can be chang@@ ed by build@@ ing com@@ bin@@ at@@ ori@@ al v@@ acc@@ in@@ es in ad@@ v@@ anc@@ e.
Her@@ e's what the f@@ ut@@ ure ma@@ y beg@@ in to look like with chang@@ ing, no@@ w, the evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary tre@@ e, spe@@ ed@@ ing up evol@@ u@@ tion with sy@@ n@@ the@@ ti@@ c bac@@ ter@@ i@@ a, Ar@@ ch@@ a@@ e@@ a and, ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally, eu@@ k@@ ar@@ y@@ o@@ t@@ es.
We@@ 're a ways a@@ way from im@@ pro@@ ving peopl@@ e: our go@@ al is just to make s@@ ure that we have a ch@@ ance to sur@@ vi@@ ve long en@@ ough to ma@@ y@@ be do that. Thank you very mu@@ ch.
What I'm going to show you fir@@ st, as qu@@ ick@@ ly as I c@@ an, is some f@@ o@@ und@@ ational wor@@ k, some new technolog@@ y that we br@@ ou@@ ght to M@@ ic@@ ro@@ so@@ ft as part of an ac@@ qu@@ is@@ iti@@ on al@@ most ex@@ ac@@ t@@ ly a ye@@ ar ag@@ o.
This is Se@@ ad@@ r@@ ag@@ on, and it's an en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment in which you can ei@@ ther lo@@ c@@ ally or re@@ mo@@ tel@@ y inter@@ ac@@ t with v@@ ast am@@ oun@@ ts of vis@@ u@@ al dat@@ a.
We@@ 're looking at man@@ y, many g@@ ig@@ ab@@ y@@ tes of dig@@ it@@ al p@@ ho@@ to@@ s here and kind of se@@ am@@ l@@ ess@@ ly and con@@ tin@@ u@@ ous@@ ly z@@ o@@ om@@ ing in, p@@ ann@@ ing through it, re@@ ar@@ r@@ ang@@ ing it in any way we wan@@ t.
And it doesn't mat@@ ter how much in@@ form@@ ation we're looking at@@ , how big these col@@ le@@ c@@ tions are or how big the imag@@ es ar@@ e.
Mo@@ st of them are ord@@ in@@ ary dig@@ it@@ al c@@ amer@@ a p@@ ho@@ to@@ s, but this on@@ e, for exam@@ pl@@ e, is a s@@ can from the Li@@ br@@ ary of C@@ on@@ gr@@ es@@ s, and it's in the 3@@ 00 me@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el r@@ ang@@ e.
It doesn't make any differ@@ ence because the only thing that ou@@ ght to li@@ mit the per@@ for@@ man@@ ce of a system like this one is the num@@ ber of pi@@ x@@ el@@ s on your s@@ cre@@ en at any gi@@ ven m@@ om@@ ent.
It's also very f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble ar@@ chit@@ ec@@ tu@@ re.
This is an enti@@ re bo@@ o@@ k, so this is an exam@@ ple of n@@ on@@ -@@ im@@ age dat@@ a.
This is "@@ B@@ le@@ a@@ k H@@ ou@@ se@@ " by D@@ ick@@ en@@ s. E@@ very col@@ um@@ n is a ch@@ ap@@ ter.
T@@ o pro@@ ve to you that it's really t@@ ex@@ t, and not an imag@@ e, we can do something like so, to really show that this is a real re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ation of the t@@ ex@@ t@@ ; it's not a pic@@ tu@@ re.
Ma@@ y@@ be this is an ar@@ ti@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ al way to re@@ ad an e-@@ bo@@ o@@ k.
I w@@ oul@@ dn't re@@ comm@@ end it.
This is a more real@@ ist@@ ic c@@ as@@ e, an is@@ su@@ e of The G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an.
E@@ very lar@@ ge im@@ age is the beg@@ inn@@ ing of a s@@ ec@@ tion.
And this really gi@@ ves you the j@@ o@@ y and the good exper@@ i@@ ence of read@@ ing the real p@@ ap@@ er ver@@ sion of a mag@@ az@@ ine or a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ a@@ per@@ , which is an in@@ her@@ ent@@ ly m@@ ul@@ ti@@ -@@ sc@@ ale kind of me@@ di@@ um@@ .
We@@ 've d@@ one something with the cor@@ n@@ er of this par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar is@@ su@@ e of The G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an.
We@@ 've made up a fa@@ ke ad that's very h@@ ig@@ h res@@ ol@@ u@@ tion -- much h@@ igh@@ er than in an ord@@ in@@ ary ad -- and we've em@@ be@@ d@@ ded ex@@ tr@@ a con@@ ten@@ t.
If you want to see the fe@@ at@@ ur@@ es of this car@@ , you can see it here.
O@@ r other mo@@ del@@ s, or even techn@@ ical spec@@ if@@ ic@@ ation@@ s.
And this really get@@ s at some of these ide@@ as about really doing a@@ way with those li@@ mit@@ s on s@@ cre@@ en real est@@ at@@ e.
We ho@@ pe that this me@@ ans no more po@@ p@@ -@@ up@@ s and other ru@@ b@@ b@@ is@@ h like that -- sh@@ oul@@ dn't be nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ y.
O@@ f cour@@ se, ma@@ pp@@ ing is one of those ob@@ vi@@ ous a@@ pp@@ lic@@ ations for a technolog@@ y like this.
And this one I really w@@ on@@ 't sp@@ end any time on, ex@@ c@@ ep@@ t to say that we have things to con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te to this f@@ iel@@ d as w@@ ell@@ .
But those are all the ro@@ ad@@ s in the U@@ .@@ S@@ .
su@@ per@@ im@@ pos@@ ed on to@@ p of a N@@ A@@ S@@ A ge@@ o@@ sp@@ ati@@ al imag@@ e.
So l@@ et's pul@@ l up@@ , no@@ w, something el@@ se.
This is actually li@@ ve on the We@@ b no@@ w@@ ; you can go ch@@ ec@@ k it ou@@ t.
This is a pro@@ jec@@ t called P@@ ho@@ to@@ sy@@ n@@ th@@ , which mar@@ ri@@ es two different techn@@ ologi@@ es.
O@@ ne of them is Se@@ ad@@ r@@ ag@@ on and the other is some very be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful comp@@ u@@ ter@@ -@@ vis@@ ion res@@ ear@@ ch d@@ one by No@@ a@@ h S@@ n@@ a@@ vel@@ y, a gra@@ du@@ ate stu@@ d@@ ent at the Univers@@ ity of Was@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on, co@@ -@@ ad@@ vis@@ ed by S@@ te@@ ve S@@ eit@@ z at U@@ .@@ W@@ .
and R@@ ic@@ k S@@ z@@ el@@ is@@ k@@ i at M@@ ic@@ ro@@ so@@ ft R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch. A very n@@ ice c@@ oll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation.
And so this is li@@ ve on the W@@ eb@@ . It's po@@ wer@@ ed by Se@@ ad@@ r@@ ag@@ on.
You can see that when we do these sor@@ ts of vie@@ w@@ s, where we can di@@ ve through imag@@ es and have this kind of m@@ ul@@ ti@@ -@@ res@@ ol@@ u@@ tion exper@@ i@@ enc@@ e.
But the sp@@ ati@@ al ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ment of the imag@@ es here is actually me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful@@ .
The comp@@ uter vis@@ ion al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ m@@ s have re@@ g@@ ist@@ er@@ ed these imag@@ es toge@@ ther so that they cor@@ res@@ p@@ on@@ d to the real spac@@ e in which these sho@@ ts -- all ta@@ ken ne@@ ar Gr@@ ass@@ i L@@ ak@@ es in the C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an Ro@@ ck@@ ies -- all these sho@@ ts were ta@@ k@@ en. So you see el@@ em@@ ents here of st@@ ab@@ ili@@ z@@ ed s@@ li@@ de@@ -@@ show or p@@ an@@ or@@ am@@ ic imag@@ ing, and these things have all been rel@@ ated sp@@ ati@@ all@@ y.
I'm not s@@ ure if I have time to show you any other en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment@@ s.
S@@ ome are much more sp@@ ati@@ al.
I would like to j@@ um@@ p st@@ ra@@ ight to one of No@@ ah@@ 's or@@ ig@@ in@@ al dat@@ a@@ -@@ s@@ et@@ s -- this is from an ear@@ ly pro@@ to@@ ty@@ pe that we first got wor@@ king this sum@@ m@@ er -- to show you what I think is really the p@@ un@@ ch l@@ ine beh@@ ind the P@@ ho@@ to@@ sy@@ n@@ th technolog@@ y, It's not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ il@@ y so a@@ pp@@ ar@@ ent from looking at the en@@ vir@@ on@@ m@@ ents we've put up on the we@@ b@@ sit@@ e.
We had to wor@@ ry about the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers and so on.
This is a re@@ con@@ stru@@ c@@ tion of No@@ tr@@ e D@@ ame C@@ a@@ the@@ dr@@ al that was d@@ one enti@@ r@@ ely comp@@ ut@@ ation@@ ally from imag@@ es sc@@ ra@@ p@@ ed from F@@ li@@ ck@@ r@@ .
You just ty@@ pe No@@ tr@@ e D@@ ame into F@@ li@@ ck@@ r@@ , and you get some pic@@ tur@@ es of gu@@ ys in T@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ t@@ s, and of the c@@ am@@ p@@ us and so on.
And each of these or@@ ang@@ e con@@ es re@@ pres@@ ents an im@@ age that was dis@@ co@@ ver@@ ed to bel@@ ong to this mo@@ del@@ .
And so these are all F@@ li@@ ck@@ r imag@@ es, and they@@ 've all been rel@@ ated sp@@ ati@@ ally in this wa@@ y.
We can just n@@ av@@ ig@@ ate in this very sim@@ ple wa@@ y.
You know, I never thought that I'@@ d end up wor@@ king at M@@ ic@@ ro@@ so@@ f@@ t.
It's very gr@@ ati@@ f@@ ying to have this kind of rec@@ ep@@ tion here.
I gu@@ ess you can see this is lo@@ ts of different ty@@ p@@ es of c@@ amer@@ as@@ : it's every@@ thing from c@@ ell@@ -@@ ph@@ one c@@ amer@@ as to pro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ al S@@ L@@ R@@ s, qu@@ ite a lar@@ ge num@@ ber of them@@ , st@@ it@@ ch@@ ed toge@@ ther in this en@@ vir@@ on@@ men@@ t.
If I can find some of the sort of wei@@ r@@ d on@@ es -- So many of them are oc@@ c@@ lu@@ ded by fac@@ es, and so on.
S@@ om@@ e@@ where in here there is actually a ser@@ ies of p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ s -- here we go@@ .
This is actually a po@@ ster of No@@ tr@@ e D@@ ame that re@@ g@@ ist@@ er@@ ed cor@@ rec@@ tl@@ y.
We can di@@ ve in from the po@@ ster to a ph@@ ysi@@ c@@ al vie@@ w of this en@@ vir@@ on@@ men@@ t.
What the poin@@ t here really is is that we can do things with the soci@@ al en@@ vir@@ on@@ men@@ t.
This is now ta@@ king dat@@ a from every@@ body -- from the enti@@ re col@@ le@@ c@@ tive mem@@ or@@ y, vis@@ u@@ ally, of what the E@@ ar@@ th loo@@ ks like -- and lin@@ k all of that toge@@ ther@@ .
Th@@ o@@ se p@@ ho@@ to@@ s be@@ come lin@@ k@@ ed, and they make something em@@ er@@ gen@@ t that's gre@@ at@@ er than the s@@ um of the par@@ ts.
You have a mo@@ de@@ l that em@@ erg@@ es of the enti@@ re E@@ ar@@ th@@ .
Th@@ in@@ k of this as the long ta@@ il to S@@ te@@ ph@@ en L@@ a@@ w@@ l@@ er@@ 's V@@ ir@@ tu@@ al E@@ ar@@ th wor@@ k.
And this is something that gro@@ ws in compl@@ ex@@ ity as people use it, and wh@@ o@@ se ben@@ ef@@ its be@@ come gre@@ at@@ er to the us@@ ers as they use it.
Th@@ ei@@ r own p@@ ho@@ to@@ s are get@@ ting t@@ ag@@ g@@ ed with m@@ et@@ a@@ -@@ dat@@ a that som@@ eb@@ o@@ dy el@@ se en@@ ter@@ ed.
If som@@ eb@@ o@@ dy bo@@ ther@@ ed to ta@@ g all of these sa@@ in@@ ts and say who they all ar@@ e, then my p@@ ho@@ to of No@@ tr@@ e D@@ ame C@@ a@@ the@@ dr@@ al su@@ d@@ den@@ ly get@@ s en@@ rich@@ ed with all of that dat@@ a, and I can use it as an ent@@ ry poin@@ t to di@@ ve into that spac@@ e, into that m@@ et@@ a@@ -@@ vers@@ e, us@@ ing every@@ body el@@ se@@ 's p@@ ho@@ to@@ s, and do a kind of a c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ mo@@ d@@ al and c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ us@@ er soci@@ al exper@@ i@@ ence that wa@@ y.
And of cour@@ se, a b@@ y@@ -@@ produc@@ t of all of that is imm@@ en@@ sel@@ y r@@ ich vir@@ tu@@ al mo@@ del@@ s of every interes@@ ting part of the E@@ ar@@ th@@ , col@@ le@@ c@@ ted not just from o@@ ver@@ he@@ ad f@@ li@@ gh@@ ts and from s@@ at@@ el@@ li@@ te imag@@ es and so on, but from the col@@ le@@ c@@ tive mem@@ or@@ y.
Thank you so mu@@ ch.
C@@ hr@@ is An@@ der@@ son@@ : D@@ o I under@@ stand this righ@@ t? What your so@@ ft@@ w@@ are is going to all@@ o@@ w, is that at some poin@@ t, really with@@ in the next few year@@ s, all the pic@@ tur@@ es that are sh@@ ar@@ ed by any@@ one ac@@ ros@@ s the world are going to lin@@ k toge@@ ther@@ ?
B@@ A@@ A@@ : Y@@ es. What this is really doing is dis@@ co@@ ver@@ ing, cre@@ ating h@@ y@@ per@@ lin@@ k@@ s, if you wi@@ ll@@ , between imag@@ es.
It's doing that bas@@ ed on the con@@ t@@ ent in@@ side the imag@@ es.
And that get@@ s really ex@@ c@@ it@@ ing when you think about the ri@@ ch@@ n@@ ess of the s@@ em@@ an@@ ti@@ c in@@ form@@ ation a lot of imag@@ es ha@@ ve.
Li@@ ke when you do a we@@ b se@@ ar@@ ch for imag@@ es, you ty@@ pe in p@@ hr@@ as@@ es, and the t@@ ex@@ t on the we@@ b p@@ age is car@@ r@@ ying a lot of in@@ form@@ ation about what that pic@@ ture is of@@ .
What if that pic@@ ture lin@@ ks to all of your pic@@ tur@@ es@@ ?
The am@@ oun@@ t of s@@ em@@ an@@ ti@@ c inter@@ con@@ nec@@ tion and ri@@ ch@@ n@@ ess that comes out of that is really h@@ u@@ g@@ e.
It's a c@@ las@@ si@@ c net@@ work eff@@ ec@@ t.
C@@ A@@ : T@@ r@@ ul@@ y incre@@ di@@ bl@@ e. C@@ on@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ation@@ s.
You know, one of the in@@ ten@@ se pl@@ eas@@ ur@@ es of tra@@ v@@ el and one of the del@@ igh@@ ts of e@@ th@@ no@@ gra@@ p@@ hi@@ c res@@ ear@@ ch is the o@@ pp@@ ort@@ un@@ ity to li@@ ve am@@ ong@@ st those who have not for@@ go@@ t@@ ten the old wa@@ y@@ s, who still fe@@ el their pas@@ t in the win@@ d, t@@ ou@@ ch it in st@@ on@@ es poli@@ sh@@ ed by ra@@ in, ta@@ ste it in the b@@ it@@ ter le@@ a@@ ves of pl@@ ant@@ s.
J@@ ust to know that J@@ ag@@ u@@ ar sh@@ am@@ ans still j@@ our@@ ne@@ y be@@ y@@ on@@ d the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ a@@ y, or the m@@ y@@ th@@ s of the In@@ u@@ it el@@ der@@ s still res@@ on@@ ate with me@@ an@@ ing, or that in the H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ a, the Bu@@ d@@ d@@ h@@ ist@@ s still p@@ ur@@ su@@ e the bre@@ at@@ h of the D@@ har@@ ma@@ , is to really re@@ mem@@ ber the cent@@ r@@ al re@@ vel@@ ation of an@@ th@@ ro@@ p@@ olog@@ y, and that is the idea that the world in which we li@@ ve does not ex@@ ist in some ab@@ sol@@ u@@ te sen@@ se, but is just one mo@@ de@@ l of real@@ ity,
the con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of one par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar se@@ t of a@@ da@@ p@@ tive ch@@ o@@ ic@@ es that our lin@@ e@@ age ma@@ de, al@@ b@@ ei@@ t su@@ c@@ c@@ ess@@ ful@@ ly, many gener@@ ations ag@@ o.
And of cour@@ se, we all sh@@ are the same a@@ da@@ p@@ tive im@@ per@@ ati@@ v@@ es.
We@@ 're all b@@ or@@ n. We all br@@ ing our childr@@ en into the world.
We go through in@@ iti@@ ation rit@@ es.
We have to de@@ al with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able se@@ par@@ ation of de@@ a@@ th@@ , so it sh@@ oul@@ dn't sur@@ pr@@ is@@ e us that we all s@@ ing, we all d@@ anc@@ e, we all have ar@@ t.
But wh@@ at's interes@@ ting is the un@@ i@@ qu@@ e c@@ a@@ den@@ ce of the son@@ g@@ , the r@@ h@@ y@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance in every cul@@ tu@@ re.
And wh@@ e@@ ther it is the P@@ en@@ an in the for@@ es@@ ts of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o, or the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in H@@ a@@ iti@@ , or the war@@ ri@@ or@@ s in the K@@ a@@ is@@ ut des@@ ert of N@@ or@@ ther@@ n K@@ en@@ y@@ a, the C@@ ur@@ ander@@ o in the mo@@ un@@ ta@@ ins of the An@@ d@@ es, or a car@@ av@@ an@@ ser@@ a@@ i in the m@@ id@@ d@@ le of the S@@ ah@@ ar@@ a -- this is in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally the f@@ el@@ lo@@ w that I tra@@ vel@@ ed into the des@@ ert with a mon@@ th ag@@ o -- or in@@ de@@ ed a y@@ a@@ k her@@ der in the s@@ lo@@ p@@ es of Q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma@@ ,
E@@ ver@@ es@@ t, the go@@ d@@ des@@ s mo@@ ther of the world.
Al@@ l of these peopl@@ es te@@ ach us that there are other ways of bein@@ g@@ , other ways of thin@@ k@@ ing, other ways of ori@@ ent@@ ing you@@ r@@ sel@@ f in the E@@ ar@@ th@@ .
And this is an ide@@ a, if you think about it, can only f@@ ill you with ho@@ p@@ e.
Now, toge@@ ther the m@@ y@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tur@@ es of the world make up a we@@ b of sp@@ ir@@ itu@@ al life and cul@@ tur@@ al life that en@@ vel@@ op@@ s the plan@@ et, and is as import@@ ant to the w@@ ell@@ -@@ being of the plan@@ et as in@@ de@@ ed is the bi@@ olog@@ ical we@@ b of life that you know as a bi@@ o@@ sp@@ here.
And you might think of this cul@@ tur@@ al we@@ b of life as being an e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here, and you might de@@ fin@@ e the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here as being the s@@ um to@@ t@@ al of all thou@@ gh@@ ts and dre@@ am@@ s, m@@ y@@ th@@ s, ide@@ as@@ , in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation@@ s, in@@ tu@@ iti@@ ons br@@ ou@@ ght into being by the human imag@@ in@@ ation sin@@ ce the da@@ wn of con@@ sci@@ ous@@ n@@ es@@ s.
The e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here is hum@@ an@@ it@@ y@@ 's great leg@@ ac@@ y.
It's the sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of all that we are and all that we can be as an ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing@@ ly in@@ qu@@ is@@ iti@@ ve spec@@ i@@ es.
And just as the bi@@ o@@ sp@@ here has been se@@ ver@@ ely er@@ o@@ de@@ d, so to@@ o is the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here -- and, if any@@ thing@@ , at a f@@ ar gre@@ at@@ er rat@@ e.
N@@ o bi@@ olog@@ ist@@ s, for exam@@ pl@@ e, would d@@ are su@@ g@@ ges@@ t that 50 percent of all spec@@ ies or more have been or are on the br@@ in@@ k of ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion because it sim@@ pl@@ y is not tru@@ e, and y@@ et that -- the most a@@ po@@ c@@ al@@ y@@ p@@ ti@@ c sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of bi@@ olog@@ ical di@@ vers@@ ity -- sc@@ ar@@ c@@ ely ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es what we know to be the most op@@ tim@@ ist@@ ic sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of cul@@ tur@@ al di@@ vers@@ ity.
And the great in@@ dic@@ at@@ or of that, of cour@@ se, is lang@@ u@@ age los@@ s.
When each of you in this ro@@ om were b@@ or@@ n, there were 6@@ ,000 lang@@ u@@ ag@@ es sp@@ o@@ ken on the plan@@ et.
Now, a lang@@ u@@ age is not just a body of v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary or a se@@ t of gr@@ amm@@ ati@@ c@@ al r@@ ul@@ es.
A lang@@ u@@ age is a f@@ las@@ h of the human sp@@ ir@@ it.
It's a v@@ eh@@ ic@@ le through which the s@@ ou@@ l of each par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar cul@@ ture comes into the mat@@ eri@@ al world.
E@@ very lang@@ u@@ age is an ol@@ d@@ -@@ gro@@ w@@ th for@@ est of the min@@ d, a wat@@ er@@ sh@@ ed, a thou@@ gh@@ t, an ec@@ o@@ system of sp@@ ir@@ itu@@ al possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ti@@ es.
And of those 6@@ ,000 lang@@ u@@ ag@@ es, as we s@@ it here to@@ day in Mon@@ ter@@ e@@ y, ful@@ ly hal@@ f are no l@@ on@@ ger being wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the ear@@ s of childr@@ en.
Th@@ ey@@ 're no l@@ on@@ ger being t@@ au@@ ght to bab@@ i@@ es, which me@@ an@@ s, eff@@ ec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y, un@@ l@@ ess something ch@@ an@@ ges@@ , they're al@@ read@@ y de@@ a@@ d.
What could be more l@@ on@@ ely than to be en@@ vel@@ op@@ ed in s@@ il@@ enc@@ e, to be the last of your people to spe@@ a@@ k your lang@@ u@@ ag@@ e, to have no way to pas@@ s on the wis@@ do@@ m of the anc@@ est@@ or@@ s or an@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate the pro@@ mis@@ e of the childr@@ en?
And y@@ et, that dre@@ ad@@ ful f@@ ate is in@@ de@@ ed the p@@ li@@ ght of som@@ eb@@ o@@ dy some@@ where on E@@ ar@@ th r@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly every two we@@ ek@@ s, because every two we@@ ek@@ s, some el@@ der dies and car@@ ri@@ es with hi@@ m into the gra@@ ve the last sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ les of an an@@ ci@@ ent t@@ on@@ gu@@ e.
And I know there's some of you who say, "@@ Well, w@@ oul@@ dn't it be bet@@ ter, w@@ oul@@ dn't the world be a bet@@ ter plac@@ e if we all just sp@@ o@@ ke one lang@@ u@@ ag@@ e@@ ?" And I say, "@@ G@@ re@@ at@@ , l@@ et's make that lang@@ u@@ age Y@@ or@@ ub@@ a. L@@ et's make it C@@ ant@@ on@@ es@@ e.
L@@ et's make it K@@ o@@ gi@@ ."
And you@@ 'll su@@ d@@ den@@ ly dis@@ co@@ ver what it would be like to be un@@ able to spe@@ a@@ k your own lang@@ u@@ ag@@ e.
And so, what I'@@ d like to do with you to@@ day is sort of take you on a j@@ our@@ ne@@ y through the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here, a b@@ rie@@ f j@@ our@@ ne@@ y through the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here, to try to beg@@ in to give you a sen@@ se of what in fac@@ t is being lo@@ st.
Now, there are many of us who sort of for@@ get that when I say "@@ different ways of bein@@ g@@ ," I really do me@@ an different ways of bein@@ g@@ .
T@@ ak@@ e, for exam@@ pl@@ e, this ch@@ ild of a B@@ ar@@ as@@ an@@ a in the N@@ or@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on, the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ da who belie@@ ve that m@@ y@@ th@@ olog@@ ic@@ ally they came up the m@@ il@@ k ri@@ ver from the e@@ ast in the b@@ ell@@ y of s@@ ac@@ red s@@ n@@ ak@@ es.
Now, this is a people who co@@ g@@ n@@ iti@@ v@@ ely do not di@@ st@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ h the col@@ or bl@@ u@@ e from the col@@ or gre@@ en because the can@@ op@@ y of the he@@ av@@ ens is e@@ qu@@ ated to the can@@ op@@ y of the for@@ est up@@ on which the people de@@ p@@ en@@ d.
They have a c@@ u@@ ri@@ ous lang@@ u@@ age and mar@@ ri@@ age ru@@ le which is called "@@ l@@ ing@@ u@@ ist@@ ic ex@@ og@@ am@@ y@@ :@@ " you m@@ ust mar@@ ry some@@ one who spe@@ ak@@ s a different lang@@ u@@ ag@@ e.
And this is all ro@@ o@@ ted in the m@@ y@@ th@@ olog@@ ical pa@@ st, y@@ et the c@@ u@@ ri@@ ous thing is in these long h@@ ous@@ es, where there are si@@ x or se@@ ven lang@@ u@@ ag@@ es sp@@ o@@ ken because of inter@@ mar@@ ri@@ ag@@ e, you never he@@ ar any@@ one pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ing a lang@@ u@@ ag@@ e.
They sim@@ pl@@ y li@@ sten and then beg@@ in to spe@@ ak@@ .
Or@@ , one of the most fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating tri@@ b@@ es I ever li@@ ved with@@ , the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i of nor@@ the@@ ast@@ ern E@@ c@@ u@@ ad@@ or@@ , an ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing people first con@@ t@@ ac@@ ted pe@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly in 19@@ 5@@ 8@@ .
In 19@@ 5@@ 7@@ , fi@@ ve mis@@ si@@ on@@ ar@@ ies at@@ tem@@ p@@ ted con@@ t@@ ac@@ t and made a c@@ rit@@ ical m@@ ist@@ ak@@ e.
They dro@@ pp@@ ed from the a@@ ir 8 x 10 g@@ los@@ s@@ y p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ s of them@@ sel@@ ves in what we would say to be fri@@ end@@ ly ges@@ tur@@ es, for@@ get@@ ting that these people of the ra@@ in@@ for@@ est had never se@@ en any@@ thing t@@ w@@ o@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ on@@ al in their li@@ v@@ es.
They pic@@ ked up these p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ s from the for@@ est f@@ lo@@ or@@ , tri@@ ed to look beh@@ ind the fac@@ e to find the for@@ m or the f@@ ig@@ u@@ re, found no@@ thing@@ , and con@@ c@@ lu@@ ded that these were call@@ ing car@@ ds from the de@@ v@@ il@@ , so they sp@@ ear@@ ed the fi@@ ve mis@@ si@@ on@@ ar@@ ies to de@@ a@@ th@@ .
But the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i didn't just spe@@ ar ou@@ t@@ si@@ der@@ s.
They sp@@ ear@@ ed each other@@ .
5@@ 4 percent of their mor@@ tal@@ ity was du@@ e to them sp@@ ear@@ ing each other@@ .
We tr@@ ac@@ ed gen@@ e@@ al@@ o@@ gi@@ es back ei@@ ght gener@@ ation@@ s, and we found two in@@ st@@ anc@@ es of nat@@ ur@@ al de@@ at@@ h and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it, they ad@@ mit@@ ted that one of the f@@ el@@ lo@@ ws had go@@ t@@ ten so old that he di@@ ed get@@ ting ol@@ d, so we sp@@ ear@@ ed hi@@ m any@@ wa@@ y. But at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ ac@@ i@@ ous kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge of the for@@ est that was ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing.
Th@@ ei@@ r h@@ unter@@ s could sm@@ ell anim@@ al ur@@ ine at 4@@ 0 p@@ ac@@ es and tell you what spec@@ ies le@@ ft it beh@@ in@@ d.
In the ear@@ ly '@@ 8@@ 0@@ s, I had a really ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing ass@@ ign@@ ment when I was as@@ ked by my pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ar@@ d if I was interes@@ ted in going down to H@@ a@@ iti@@ , in@@ f@@ il@@ tr@@ ating the s@@ ec@@ re@@ t so@@ c@@ ie@@ ti@@ es which were the f@@ o@@ und@@ ation of D@@ u@@ v@@ al@@ ier@@ 's str@@ eng@@ th and T@@ on@@ t@@ on M@@ ac@@ ou@@ t@@ es, and s@@ ec@@ ur@@ ing the po@@ is@@ on used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es.
In or@@ der to make sen@@ se out of sen@@ s@@ ation, of cour@@ se, I had to under@@ stand something about this re@@ mark@@ able fa@@ it@@ h of V@@ o@@ do@@ un@@ . And V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is not a bl@@ ack mag@@ ic cul@@ t.
O@@ n the con@@ tr@@ ar@@ y, it's a compl@@ e@@ x m@@ et@@ ap@@ h@@ ysi@@ c@@ al worl@@ d@@ vie@@ w.
It's inter@@ est@@ ing.
If I as@@ ked you to n@@ ame the great rel@@ ig@@ i@@ ons of the worl@@ d, what would you sa@@ y@@ ?
Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ i@@ an@@ ity, I@@ s@@ l@@ am@@ , Bu@@ d@@ d@@ h@@ is@@ m, J@@ u@@ da@@ is@@ m, wh@@ at@@ ever@@ .
Ther@@ e's al@@ ways one con@@ tin@@ ent le@@ ft ou@@ t, the ass@@ um@@ p@@ tion being that sub@@ -@@ S@@ ah@@ ar@@ an Afric@@ a had no rel@@ ig@@ i@@ ous belie@@ f@@ s. Well, of cour@@ se, they did and V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is sim@@ pl@@ y the di@@ st@@ ill@@ ation of these very pro@@ found rel@@ ig@@ i@@ ous ide@@ as that came over dur@@ ing the tr@@ ag@@ ic Di@@ as@@ p@@ or@@ a of the s@@ la@@ very er@@ a.
Bu@@ t, what ma@@ kes V@@ oo@@ do@@ o so interes@@ ting is that it's this li@@ ving rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p between the li@@ ving and the de@@ a@@ d.
So, the li@@ ving give b@@ ir@@ th to the sp@@ ir@@ it@@ s.
The sp@@ ir@@ its can be inv@@ o@@ ked from ben@@ e@@ at@@ h the G@@ re@@ at W@@ at@@ er, res@@ p@@ on@@ ding to the r@@ h@@ y@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance to m@@ om@@ ent@@ ar@@ il@@ y dis@@ plac@@ e the s@@ ou@@ l of the li@@ v@@ ing, so that for that b@@ rie@@ f sh@@ in@@ ing m@@ om@@ ent, the ac@@ ol@@ y@@ te be@@ comes the go@@ d.
That's why the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o@@ ist@@ s like to say that "@@ You wh@@ ite people go to ch@@ ur@@ ch and spe@@ a@@ k about Go@@ d.
We d@@ ance in the tem@@ ple and be@@ come Go@@ d@@ ."
And because you are pos@@ s@@ es@@ se@@ d, you are ta@@ ken by the sp@@ ir@@ it -- how can you be har@@ me@@ d@@ ?
So you see these ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation@@ s@@ : V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in a st@@ ate of tr@@ ance h@@ and@@ l@@ ing b@@ ur@@ ning em@@ ber@@ s with imp@@ un@@ ity, a ra@@ ther ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation of the ab@@ ili@@ ty of the m@@ ind to aff@@ ect the body that be@@ ar@@ s it when c@@ at@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed in the st@@ ate of ex@@ tre@@ me ex@@ c@@ it@@ ation.
Now, of all the peopl@@ es that I've ever been with@@ , the most ex@@ tra@@ ord@@ in@@ ary are the K@@ og@@ i of the S@@ ier@@ r@@ a N@@ ev@@ ad@@ a de S@@ ant@@ a Mar@@ t@@ a in nor@@ ther@@ n C@@ ol@@ om@@ bi@@ a.
Des@@ c@@ end@@ an@@ ts of the an@@ ci@@ ent Ta@@ ir@@ on@@ a ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation which on@@ ce car@@ p@@ et@@ ed the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in of C@@ ol@@ om@@ bi@@ a, in the wa@@ ke of the con@@ ques@@ t, these people re@@ tre@@ ated into an is@@ ol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic m@@ as@@ si@@ f that so@@ ar@@ s ab@@ o@@ ve the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pl@@ ain@@ .
In a b@@ loo@@ d@@ st@@ ain@@ ed con@@ tin@@ ent, these people al@@ one were never con@@ qu@@ er@@ ed by the Sp@@ an@@ is@@ h@@ .
T@@ o this da@@ y, they re@@ ma@@ in r@@ ul@@ ed by a rit@@ u@@ al pri@@ es@@ th@@ oo@@ d but the tra@@ in@@ ing for the pri@@ es@@ th@@ oo@@ d is ra@@ ther ex@@ tra@@ ord@@ in@@ ar@@ y.
The y@@ o@@ ung ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes are ta@@ ken a@@ way from their fam@@ ili@@ es at the age of three and f@@ our@@ , se@@ ques@@ ter@@ ed in a s@@ ha@@ do@@ w@@ y world of dar@@ k@@ n@@ ess in st@@ one h@@ ut@@ s at the bas@@ e of gl@@ ac@@ ier@@ s for 1@@ 8 year@@ s@@ : two n@@ in@@ e-@@ ye@@ ar per@@ i@@ o@@ ds del@@ i@@ ber@@ at@@ ely ch@@ o@@ s@@ en to m@@ im@@ ic the n@@ ine mon@@ th@@ s of ges@@ t@@ ation they sp@@ end in their nat@@ ur@@ al mo@@ ther@@ 's wom@@ b@@ ; now they are m@@ et@@ ap@@ h@@ or@@ ic@@ ally in the wom@@ b of the great mo@@ ther@@ .
And for this enti@@ re time, they are in@@ cul@@ tur@@ ated into the v@@ al@@ u@@ es of their soci@@ et@@ y, v@@ al@@ u@@ es that ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in the pro@@ pos@@ iti@@ on that their p@@ ra@@ y@@ ers and their p@@ ra@@ y@@ ers al@@ one ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in the co@@ sm@@ ic -- or we might say the ec@@ olog@@ ical -- b@@ al@@ anc@@ e.
And at the end of this am@@ az@@ ing in@@ iti@@ ation, one day they're su@@ d@@ den@@ ly ta@@ ken out and for the first time in their li@@ v@@ es, at the age of 1@@ 8@@ , they see a s@@ un@@ ris@@ e. And in that c@@ r@@ y@@ st@@ al m@@ om@@ ent of a@@ war@@ en@@ ess of first li@@ ght as the Su@@ n beg@@ ins to b@@ a@@ the the s@@ lo@@ p@@ es of the st@@ un@@ n@@ ing@@ ly be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e, su@@ d@@ den@@ ly every@@ thing they have lear@@ n@@ ed in the ab@@ str@@ ac@@ t is aff@@ ir@@ m@@ ed in st@@ un@@ ning gl@@ or@@ y. And the pri@@ est st@@ ep@@ s back
and sa@@ y@@ s, "@@ You se@@ e? It's really as I've t@@ old you.
It is that be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful@@ . It is you@@ r@@ s to pro@@ t@@ ec@@ t@@ ."
They c@@ all them@@ sel@@ ves the "@@ el@@ der b@@ ro@@ ther@@ s@@ " and they say w@@ e, who are the y@@ o@@ ung@@ er b@@ ro@@ ther@@ s, are the on@@ es res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ ble for des@@ tro@@ ying the world.
Now, this le@@ v@@ el of in@@ tu@@ iti@@ on be@@ comes very import@@ an@@ t.
Wh@@ en@@ ever we think of in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people and l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e, we ei@@ ther inv@@ o@@ ke R@@ ous@@ se@@ a@@ u and the old can@@ ar@@ d of the "@@ no@@ ble sa@@ v@@ ag@@ e@@ ," which is an idea r@@ ac@@ ist in its sim@@ p@@ lic@@ ity, or al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ vel@@ y, we inv@@ o@@ ke Th@@ or@@ e@@ a@@ u and say these people are c@@ los@@ er to the E@@ ar@@ th than we ar@@ e.
Well, in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people are n@@ ei@@ ther sen@@ tim@@ ent@@ al no@@ r we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed by no@@ st@@ al@@ gi@@ a.
Ther@@ e's not a lot of ro@@ om for ei@@ ther in the m@@ al@@ ari@@ al s@@ w@@ am@@ ps of the A@@ sm@@ at or in the ch@@ ill@@ ing win@@ ds of T@@ i@@ bet@@ , but they ha@@ ve, ne@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ es@@ s, through time and rit@@ u@@ al, for@@ g@@ ed a tra@@ diti@@ on@@ al m@@ y@@ st@@ i@@ qu@@ e of the E@@ ar@@ th that is bas@@ ed not on the idea of being self@@ -@@ con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ly c@@ lo@@ se to it, but on a f@@ ar sub@@ tl@@ er in@@ tu@@ iti@@ on@@ : the idea that the E@@ ar@@ th it@@ sel@@ f can only ex@@ ist because it is bre@@ a@@ th@@ ed into being by human con@@ sci@@ ous@@ n@@ es@@ s.
Now, what does that me@@ an@@ ?
It me@@ ans that a y@@ o@@ ung ki@@ d from the An@@ des wh@@ o@@ 's ra@@ is@@ ed to belie@@ ve that that mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in is an A@@ p@@ u sp@@ ir@@ it that will di@@ rec@@ t his or her des@@ tin@@ y will be a pro@@ f@@ o@@ und@@ ly different human being and have a different rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p to that res@@ our@@ ce or that plac@@ e than a y@@ o@@ ung ki@@ d from Mon@@ t@@ an@@ a ra@@ is@@ ed to belie@@ ve that a mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in is a p@@ ile of ro@@ ck read@@ y to be min@@ ed.
W@@ he@@ ther it's the ab@@ o@@ de of a sp@@ ir@@ it or a p@@ ile of or@@ e is ir@@ rel@@ ev@@ an@@ t.
W@@ hat@@ 's interes@@ ting is the m@@ et@@ ap@@ h@@ or that de@@ fin@@ es the rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p between the in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al and the nat@@ ur@@ al world.
I was ra@@ is@@ ed in the for@@ es@@ ts of B@@ rit@@ is@@ h C@@ ol@@ um@@ bi@@ a to belie@@ ve those for@@ es@@ ts ex@@ ist@@ ed to be c@@ u@@ t.
That made me a different human being than my fri@@ en@@ ds am@@ ong@@ st the K@@ w@@ ag@@ i@@ ul@@ th who belie@@ ve that those for@@ es@@ ts were the ab@@ o@@ de of H@@ u@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the C@@ ro@@ o@@ ked Be@@ a@@ k of H@@ e@@ a@@ ven and the c@@ ann@@ i@@ b@@ al sp@@ ir@@ its that d@@ w@@ ell@@ ed at the nor@@ th end of the worl@@ d, sp@@ ir@@ its they would have to eng@@ age dur@@ ing their H@@ am@@ at@@ s@@ a in@@ iti@@ ation.
Now, if you beg@@ in to look at the idea that these cul@@ tur@@ es could cre@@ ate different real@@ iti@@ es, you could beg@@ in to under@@ stand some of their ex@@ tra@@ ord@@ in@@ ary dis@@ co@@ ver@@ i@@ es. Ta@@ ke this pl@@ ant here.
It's a p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ p@@ h I to@@ ok in the N@@ or@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on just last A@@ pri@@ l@@ .
This is a@@ y@@ ah@@ u@@ as@@ c@@ a, which many of you have hear@@ d ab@@ ou@@ t, the most po@@ wer@@ ful p@@ sy@@ ch@@ o@@ ac@@ tive pre@@ par@@ ation of the sh@@ am@@ an@@ 's re@@ per@@ to@@ i@@ re.
What ma@@ kes a@@ y@@ ah@@ u@@ as@@ c@@ a fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating is not the sh@@ e@@ er ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ olog@@ ical po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al of this pre@@ par@@ ation, but the el@@ ab@@ or@@ ation of it. It's made really of two different s@@ our@@ c@@ es@@ : on the one h@@ and, this w@@ oo@@ dy li@@ an@@ a which has in it a ser@@ ies of bet@@ a@@ -@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ in@@ es, har@@ min@@ e, har@@ m@@ al@@ in@@ e, m@@ ild@@ ly h@@ all@@ u@@ c@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ ic -- to take the v@@ ine al@@ one is ra@@ ther to have sort of bl@@ u@@ e ha@@ z@@ y s@@ mo@@ ke dri@@ ft ac@@ ros@@ s your con@@ sci@@ ous@@ n@@ ess -- but it's m@@ i@@ x@@ ed with the le@@ a@@ ves of a s@@ hr@@ u@@ b in the co@@ ff@@ e@@ e fam@@ il@@ y
called P@@ sy@@ ch@@ o@@ tri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ dis@@ .
This pl@@ ant had in it some very po@@ wer@@ ful tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ es, very c@@ lo@@ se to bra@@ in ser@@ o@@ t@@ on@@ in, di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ e, 5@@ -@@ me@@ tho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ e.
If you@@ 've ever se@@ en the Y@@ an@@ om@@ am@@ i b@@ lo@@ wing that s@@ nu@@ f@@ f up their no@@ s@@ es, that sub@@ st@@ ance they make from a different se@@ t of spec@@ ies also con@@ ta@@ ins me@@ tho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ e.
T@@ o have that po@@ w@@ der b@@ lo@@ wn up your no@@ se is ra@@ ther like being sho@@ t out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ re@@ l lin@@ ed with bar@@ o@@ qu@@ e pa@@ in@@ t@@ ing@@ s and l@@ and@@ ing on a se@@ a of el@@ ec@@ tri@@ c@@ ity. It doesn't cre@@ ate the di@@ stor@@ tion of real@@ it@@ y@@ ; it cre@@ at@@ es the dis@@ sol@@ u@@ tion of real@@ ity.
In fac@@ t, I used to ar@@ gu@@ e with my pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or@@ , R@@ ich@@ ar@@ d E@@ v@@ an S@@ h@@ ul@@ tes -- who is a man who sp@@ ar@@ ked the p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ed@@ el@@ ic er@@ a with his dis@@ co@@ very of the mag@@ ic mus@@ h@@ ro@@ om@@ s in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o in the 19@@ 3@@ 0@@ s -- I used to ar@@ gu@@ e that you c@@ oul@@ dn't c@@ las@@ si@@ f@@ y these tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ es as h@@ all@@ u@@ c@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ ic because by the time you're un@@ der the eff@@ ec@@ ts there's no one h@@ ome any@@ more to exper@@ i@@ ence a h@@ all@@ u@@ c@@ in@@ ation. But the thing about tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ es is they can@@ not be ta@@ ken or@@ ally
because they're den@@ at@@ u@@ red by an enz@@ y@@ me found nat@@ ur@@ ally in the human g@@ ut called mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine o@@ x@@ i@@ d@@ as@@ e.
They can only be ta@@ ken or@@ ally if ta@@ ken in con@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion with some other ch@@ em@@ ical that den@@ at@@ ur@@ es the M@@ A@@ O@@ .
Now, the fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating things are that the bet@@ a@@ -@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ in@@ es found with@@ in that li@@ an@@ a are M@@ A@@ O in@@ hi@@ b@@ it@@ or@@ s of the pre@@ c@@ is@@ e sort nec@@ ess@@ ary to po@@ ten@@ ti@@ ate the tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ e. So you as@@ k you@@ r@@ sel@@ f a ques@@ tion.
Ho@@ w, in a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0@@ ,000 spec@@ ies of v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar pl@@ ant@@ s, do these people find these two mor@@ ph@@ olog@@ ic@@ ally un@@ rel@@ ated plan@@ ts that when com@@ bin@@ ed in this way, cre@@ ated a kind of bi@@ o@@ ch@@ em@@ ical ver@@ sion of the whole being gre@@ at@@ er than the s@@ um of the par@@ ts@@ ?
Well, we use that great eu@@ ph@@ em@@ is@@ m, "@@ tri@@ al and err@@ or@@ ," which is ex@@ pos@@ ed to be me@@ an@@ ing@@ l@@ es@@ s.
But you as@@ k the Indi@@ an@@ s, and they say, "@@ The plan@@ ts talk to us@@ ."
Well, what does that me@@ an@@ ?
This tri@@ b@@ e, the C@@ of@@ an, has 1@@ 7 v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ti@@ es of a@@ y@@ ah@@ u@@ as@@ c@@ a, all of which they di@@ st@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ h a great di@@ st@@ ance in the for@@ es@@ t, all of which are re@@ fer@@ able to our ey@@ e as one spec@@ i@@ es.
And then you as@@ k them how they est@@ ab@@ li@@ s@@ h their ta@@ x@@ on@@ om@@ y and they say, "@@ I thought you k@@ new something about pl@@ ant@@ s.
I me@@ an, don't you know any@@ thing@@ ?" And I said, "@@ No@@ ."
Well, it tur@@ n@@ s out you take each of the 1@@ 7 v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ti@@ es in the n@@ ight of a ful@@ l mo@@ on, and it s@@ ing@@ s to you in a different ke@@ y.
Now, that's not going to get you a Ph@@ .@@ D@@ . at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ar@@ d, but it's a lot more interes@@ ting than coun@@ ting st@@ am@@ en@@ s. Now -- -- the pro@@ blem -- the pro@@ blem is that even those of us sy@@ m@@ pa@@ the@@ ti@@ c with the p@@ li@@ ght of in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people vie@@ w them as qu@@ ain@@ t and col@@ or@@ ful but som@@ eh@@ o@@ w re@@ duc@@ ed to the mar@@ g@@ ins of h@@ ist@@ or@@ y as the real worl@@ d, me@@ an@@ ing our worl@@ d, mo@@ ves on.
Well, the tr@@ ut@@ h is the 20@@ th cent@@ ur@@ y, 3@@ 00 years from no@@ w, is not going to be re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed for its war@@ s or its technolog@@ ical in@@ no@@ v@@ ation@@ s, but ra@@ ther as the er@@ a in which we st@@ oo@@ d by the m@@ as@@ si@@ ve des@@ tru@@ c@@ tion of bo@@ th bi@@ olog@@ ical and cul@@ tur@@ al di@@ vers@@ ity on the plan@@ et. Now, the pro@@ blem is@@ n't chang@@ e.
Al@@ l cul@@ tur@@ es through all time have con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly been eng@@ ag@@ ed in a d@@ ance with new possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ti@@ es of lif@@ e.
And the pro@@ blem is not technolog@@ y it@@ self@@ .
The Si@@ ou@@ x Indi@@ ans did not sto@@ p being Si@@ ou@@ x when they ga@@ ve up the bo@@ w and ar@@ ro@@ w any more than an Americ@@ an sto@@ pp@@ ed being an Americ@@ an when he ga@@ ve up the h@@ or@@ se and bu@@ g@@ g@@ y.
It's not change or technolog@@ y that thre@@ at@@ ens the in@@ te@@ gr@@ ity of the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here. It is po@@ wer@@ , the c@@ ru@@ de fac@@ e of d@@ om@@ in@@ ation.
W@@ her@@ ever you look around the worl@@ d, you dis@@ co@@ ver that these are not cul@@ tur@@ es des@@ tin@@ ed to fa@@ de a@@ wa@@ y@@ ; these are d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic li@@ ving peopl@@ es being dri@@ ven out of ex@@ ist@@ ence by i@@ den@@ ti@@ fi@@ able for@@ c@@ es that are be@@ y@@ on@@ d their cap@@ ac@@ ity to a@@ da@@ p@@ t to@@ : wh@@ e@@ ther it's the eg@@ re@@ gi@@ ous de@@ for@@ est@@ ation in the h@@ om@@ el@@ and of the P@@ en@@ an -- a n@@ om@@ a@@ di@@ c people from S@@ ou@@ the@@ ast A@@ si@@ a, from S@@ ar@@ a@@ wa@@ k -- a people who li@@ ved fre@@ e in the for@@ est un@@ ti@@ l a gener@@ ation ag@@ o,
and now have all been re@@ duc@@ ed to ser@@ v@@ itu@@ de and pro@@ st@@ itu@@ tion on the b@@ an@@ ks of the ri@@ ver@@ s, where you can see the ri@@ ver it@@ sel@@ f is so@@ il@@ ed with the s@@ il@@ t that se@@ em@@ s to be car@@ r@@ ying hal@@ f of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o a@@ way to the S@@ ou@@ th Chin@@ a Se@@ a, where the J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese f@@ r@@ ei@@ gh@@ ter@@ s h@@ an@@ g li@@ ght in the h@@ or@@ iz@@ on read@@ y to f@@ ill their hol@@ ds with ra@@ w lo@@ g@@ s ri@@ pp@@ ed from the for@@ est -- or@@ , in the c@@ ase of the Y@@ an@@ om@@ am@@ i@@ ,
it's the dis@@ eas@@ e ent@@ iti@@ es that have come in, in the wa@@ ke of the dis@@ co@@ very of g@@ ol@@ d.
O@@ r if we go into the mo@@ un@@ ta@@ ins of T@@ i@@ bet@@ , where I'm doing a lot of res@@ ear@@ ch rec@@ ent@@ ly, you@@ 'll see it's a c@@ ru@@ de fac@@ e of poli@@ tic@@ al d@@ om@@ in@@ ation.
You know, gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de, the ph@@ ysi@@ c@@ al ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion of a people is un@@ ivers@@ ally con@@ de@@ m@@ ne@@ d, but e@@ th@@ no@@ ci@@ de, the des@@ tru@@ c@@ tion of peopl@@ e's way of lif@@ e, is not only not con@@ de@@ m@@ ne@@ d, it's un@@ ivers@@ ally, in many qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ s, c@@ el@@ eb@@ r@@ ated as part of a devel@@ op@@ ment str@@ at@@ eg@@ y.
And you can@@ not under@@ stand the pa@@ in of T@@ i@@ be@@ t un@@ ti@@ l you mo@@ ve through it at the gro@@ und le@@ vel@@ .
I on@@ ce tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ed 6@@ ,000 m@@ il@@ es from Ch@@ eng@@ d@@ u in W@@ es@@ tern Chin@@ a o@@ ver@@ l@@ and through s@@ ou@@ the@@ ast@@ ern T@@ i@@ be@@ t to L@@ h@@ as@@ a with a y@@ o@@ ung col@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ e, and it was only when I got to L@@ h@@ as@@ a that I under@@ st@@ oo@@ d the fac@@ e beh@@ ind the st@@ ati@@ st@@ ic@@ s you he@@ ar ab@@ ou@@ t: 6@@ ,000 s@@ ac@@ red mon@@ um@@ ents tor@@ n ap@@ ar@@ t to d@@ ust and as@@ h@@ es, 1@@ .@@ 2 million people k@@ ill@@ ed by the c@@ ad@@ r@@ es dur@@ ing the C@@ ul@@ tur@@ al R@@ evol@@ u@@ tion.
This y@@ o@@ ung man@@ 's fa@@ ther had been as@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ed to the P@@ an@@ ch@@ en L@@ am@@ a.
That me@@ ant he was in@@ st@@ ant@@ ly k@@ ill@@ ed at the time of the Chin@@ ese inv@@ as@@ i@@ on.
H@@ is un@@ c@@ le fl@@ ed with H@@ is H@@ ol@@ in@@ ess in the Di@@ as@@ p@@ or@@ a that to@@ ok the people to N@@ ep@@ al.
H@@ is mo@@ ther was in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated for the c@@ ri@@ me of being we@@ al@@ th@@ y.
He was s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed into the j@@ a@@ il at the age of two to hi@@ de ben@@ e@@ at@@ h her sk@@ ir@@ t ta@@ il@@ s because she c@@ oul@@ dn't be@@ ar to be with@@ out h@@ im@@ .
The si@@ ster who had d@@ one that bra@@ ve de@@ ed was put into an e@@ duc@@ ation c@@ am@@ p@@ .
O@@ ne day she in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ent@@ ly ste@@ pp@@ ed on an ar@@ m@@ b@@ and of Ma@@ o, and for that trans@@ gr@@ es@@ si@@ on, she was gi@@ ven se@@ ven years of har@@ d l@@ ab@@ or@@ .
The pa@@ in of T@@ i@@ be@@ t can be im@@ possi@@ ble to be@@ ar@@ , but the re@@ de@@ m@@ p@@ tive sp@@ ir@@ it of the people is something to beh@@ ol@@ d.
And in the en@@ d, th@@ en, it really comes down to a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e: do we want to li@@ ve in a mon@@ o@@ ch@@ ro@@ m@@ ati@@ c world of mon@@ o@@ t@@ on@@ y or do we want to em@@ br@@ ac@@ e a p@@ ol@@ y@@ ch@@ ro@@ m@@ ati@@ c world of di@@ vers@@ it@@ y@@ ?
Mar@@ g@@ ar@@ et Me@@ a@@ d, the great an@@ th@@ ro@@ p@@ olog@@ ist, said, befor@@ e she di@@ ed, that her gre@@ at@@ est fe@@ ar was that as we dri@@ f@@ ted to@@ war@@ ds this bl@@ and@@ ly am@@ or@@ ph@@ ous gener@@ ic world vie@@ w not only would we see the enti@@ re r@@ ang@@ e of the human imag@@ in@@ ation re@@ duc@@ ed to a more n@@ ar@@ ro@@ w mo@@ d@@ al@@ ity of thou@@ gh@@ t, but that we would wa@@ ke from a dre@@ am one day ha@@ ving for@@ go@@ t@@ ten there were even other possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ti@@ es.
And it's hum@@ bl@@ ing to re@@ mem@@ ber that our spec@@ ies h@@ as@@ , per@@ ha@@ p@@ s, been around for [@@ 1@@ 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ ] year@@ s.
The Ne@@ o@@ li@@ th@@ ic R@@ evol@@ u@@ tion -- which ga@@ ve us ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ tu@@ re, at which time we su@@ c@@ c@@ um@@ b@@ ed to the cul@@ t of the se@@ ed@@ ; the po@@ et@@ ry of the sh@@ am@@ an was dis@@ plac@@ ed by the pro@@ se of the pri@@ es@@ th@@ oo@@ d@@ ; we cre@@ ated h@@ ier@@ ar@@ ch@@ y spec@@ i@@ al@@ iz@@ ation sur@@ pl@@ us -- is only 1@@ 0@@ ,000 years ag@@ o.
The mo@@ dern in@@ du@@ stri@@ al world as we know it is bar@@ ely 3@@ 00 years ol@@ d.
Now, that sh@@ all@@ o@@ w h@@ ist@@ or@@ y doesn't su@@ g@@ ges@@ t to me that we have all the ans@@ wer@@ s for all of the ch@@ all@@ eng@@ es that will con@@ fr@@ on@@ t us in the en@@ su@@ ing m@@ ill@@ enn@@ i@@ a.
When these m@@ y@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tur@@ es of the world are as@@ ked the me@@ an@@ ing of being hum@@ an, they res@@ p@@ on@@ d with 1@@ 0@@ ,000 different v@@ o@@ ic@@ es.
And it's with@@ in that son@@ g that we will all re@@ dis@@ co@@ ver the possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ty of being what we ar@@ e: a ful@@ ly con@@ sci@@ ous spec@@ i@@ es, ful@@ ly a@@ w@@ are of en@@ sur@@ ing that all peopl@@ es and all g@@ ar@@ den@@ s find a way to fl@@ our@@ is@@ h@@ . And there are great m@@ om@@ ents of op@@ tim@@ is@@ m.
This is a p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ p@@ h I to@@ ok at the nor@@ ther@@ n ti@@ p of B@@ aff@@ in I@@ s@@ l@@ and when I went n@@ ar@@ wh@@ al h@@ un@@ ting with some In@@ u@@ it peopl@@ e, and this man@@ , O@@ la@@ y@@ u@@ k, t@@ old me a mar@@ vel@@ ous stor@@ y of his gr@@ and@@ fa@@ ther@@ .
The C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment has not al@@ ways been kind to the In@@ u@@ it peopl@@ e, and dur@@ ing the 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s, to est@@ ab@@ li@@ s@@ h our so@@ ver@@ eig@@ n@@ t@@ y, we for@@ c@@ ed them into s@@ et@@ tl@@ em@@ ent@@ s.
This old man@@ 's gr@@ and@@ fa@@ ther re@@ f@@ used to go@@ .
The fam@@ il@@ y, f@@ ear@@ ful for his lif@@ e, to@@ ok a@@ way all of his we@@ ap@@ on@@ s, all of his to@@ ol@@ s.
Now, you m@@ ust under@@ stand that the In@@ u@@ it did not fe@@ ar the col@@ d@@ ; they to@@ ok ad@@ v@@ ant@@ age of it.
The r@@ un@@ n@@ ers of their s@@ le@@ ds were or@@ ig@@ in@@ ally made of f@@ is@@ h w@@ ra@@ pp@@ ed in car@@ i@@ b@@ o@@ u hi@@ de.
So, this man@@ 's gr@@ and@@ fa@@ ther was not in@@ tim@@ id@@ ated by the Ar@@ c@@ ti@@ c n@@ ight or the b@@ li@@ z@@ z@@ ar@@ d that was b@@ lo@@ w@@ ing.
He sim@@ pl@@ y s@@ li@@ pp@@ ed ou@@ t@@ si@@ de, pul@@ l@@ ed down his se@@ al@@ sk@@ in tr@@ ou@@ ser@@ s and de@@ f@@ ec@@ ated into his h@@ an@@ d. And as the f@@ ec@@ es beg@@ an to fre@@ e@@ z@@ e, he s@@ ha@@ p@@ ed it into the for@@ m of a bl@@ ad@@ e.
He put a sp@@ ra@@ y of s@@ ali@@ v@@ a on the ed@@ ge of the sh@@ it k@@ n@@ if@@ e and as it fin@@ ally fro@@ ze so@@ li@@ d, he b@@ ut@@ ch@@ er@@ ed a do@@ g with it.

Talk about get@@ ting by with no@@ thing@@ . And this, in many ways -- -- is a sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of the res@@ ili@@ ence of the In@@ u@@ it people and of all in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people around the world.
The C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment in A@@ pri@@ l of 19@@ 9@@ 9 ga@@ ve back to to@@ t@@ al con@@ tro@@ l of the In@@ u@@ it an ar@@ e@@ a of l@@ and lar@@ ger than C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a and T@@ ex@@ as put toge@@ ther@@ .
It's our new h@@ om@@ el@@ an@@ d. It's called N@@ un@@ av@@ u@@ t.
It's an in@@ de@@ p@@ end@@ ent ter@@ rit@@ or@@ y. They con@@ tro@@ l all min@@ er@@ al res@@ our@@ c@@ es.
A@@ n am@@ az@@ ing exam@@ ple of how a n@@ ation@@ -@@ st@@ ate can se@@ e@@ k res@@ tit@@ u@@ tion with its peopl@@ e.
And fin@@ ally, in the en@@ d, I think it's pre@@ tt@@ y ob@@ vi@@ ous at le@@ ast to all of all us wh@@ o@@ 've tra@@ vel@@ ed in these re@@ mo@@ te re@@ ach@@ es of the plan@@ et, to real@@ iz@@ e that they're not re@@ mo@@ te at all@@ .
Th@@ ey@@ 're h@@ om@@ el@@ and@@ s of som@@ eb@@ o@@ d@@ y.
They re@@ pres@@ ent br@@ an@@ ch@@ es of the human imag@@ in@@ ation that go back to the da@@ wn of time. And for all of us@@ , the dre@@ am@@ s of these childr@@ en, like the dre@@ am@@ s of our own childr@@ en, be@@ come part of the n@@ ak@@ ed ge@@ og@@ ra@@ ph@@ y of ho@@ p@@ e.
So, what we're tr@@ ying to do at the N@@ ational Ge@@ og@@ ra@@ ph@@ ic@@ , fin@@ ally, is, we belie@@ ve that poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans will never ac@@ comp@@ li@@ s@@ h any@@ thing@@ .
We think that p@@ ol@@ em@@ ic@@ s -- -- we think that p@@ ol@@ em@@ ic@@ s are not per@@ su@@ as@@ i@@ ve, but we think that stor@@ y@@ tell@@ ing can change the worl@@ d, and so we are pro@@ bab@@ ly the bes@@ t stor@@ y@@ tell@@ ing in@@ st@@ itu@@ tion in the world. We get 3@@ 5 million h@@ its on our we@@ b@@ s@@ ite every mon@@ th@@ .
1@@ 5@@ 6 n@@ ations car@@ ry our tel@@ ev@@ is@@ ion ch@@ ann@@ el@@ .
O@@ ur mag@@ az@@ in@@ es are re@@ ad by m@@ illi@@ on@@ s.
And what we're doing is a ser@@ ies of j@@ our@@ ne@@ ys to the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here where we're going to take our au@@ di@@ ence to plac@@ es of su@@ ch cul@@ tur@@ al w@@ on@@ der that they can@@ not hel@@ p but come a@@ way da@@ z@@ z@@ l@@ ed by what they have se@@ en, and ho@@ pe@@ ful@@ ly, ther@@ e@@ for@@ e, em@@ br@@ ac@@ e gra@@ du@@ ally, one by on@@ e, the cent@@ r@@ al re@@ vel@@ ation of an@@ th@@ ro@@ p@@ olog@@ y@@ : that this world des@@ er@@ ves to ex@@ ist in a di@@ ver@@ se way, that we can find a way to li@@ ve in a tr@@ ul@@ y m@@ ul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tur@@ al, pl@@ ur@@ al@@ ist@@ ic world
where all of the wis@@ do@@ m of all peopl@@ es can con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te to our col@@ le@@ c@@ tive w@@ ell@@ -@@ bein@@ g@@ .
Thank you very mu@@ ch.
I'm going to talk to you about some stu@@ f@@ f that's in this bo@@ ok of m@@ ine that I ho@@ pe will res@@ on@@ ate with other things you@@ 've al@@ read@@ y hear@@ d, and I'@@ ll try to make some con@@ nec@@ tions m@@ y@@ self@@ , in c@@ ase you mis@@ s@@ ed them.
But I want to start with what I c@@ all the "@@ off@@ ic@@ i@@ al do@@ g@@ ma@@ ."
The off@@ ic@@ i@@ al do@@ g@@ m@@ a of wh@@ at@@ ?
The off@@ ic@@ i@@ al do@@ g@@ m@@ a of all W@@ es@@ tern in@@ du@@ stri@@ al so@@ c@@ ie@@ ti@@ es.
And the off@@ ic@@ i@@ al do@@ g@@ m@@ a r@@ uns like th@@ is@@ : if we are interes@@ ted in ma@@ x@@ im@@ iz@@ ing the wel@@ f@@ are of our c@@ iti@@ z@@ en@@ s, the way to do that is to ma@@ x@@ im@@ iz@@ e in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al fre@@ ed@@ om@@ .
The reas@@ on for this is bo@@ th that fre@@ e@@ do@@ m is in and of it@@ sel@@ f go@@ o@@ d, v@@ al@@ u@@ abl@@ e, wor@@ th@@ wh@@ il@@ e, ess@@ enti@@ al to being hum@@ an.
And because if people have fre@@ ed@@ om@@ , then each of us can ac@@ t on our own to do the things that will ma@@ x@@ im@@ iz@@ e our wel@@ f@@ ar@@ e, and no one has to de@@ ci@@ de on our beh@@ al@@ f@@ .
The way to ma@@ x@@ im@@ iz@@ e fre@@ e@@ do@@ m is to ma@@ x@@ im@@ iz@@ e ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e.
The more ch@@ o@@ ice people ha@@ ve, the more fre@@ e@@ do@@ m they ha@@ ve, and the more fre@@ e@@ do@@ m they ha@@ ve, the more wel@@ f@@ are they ha@@ ve.
Th@@ is, I thin@@ k, is so de@@ e@@ pl@@ y em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in the wat@@ er su@@ p@@ pl@@ y that it w@@ oul@@ dn't oc@@ c@@ ur to any@@ one to ques@@ tion it.
And it's also de@@ e@@ pl@@ y em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in our li@@ v@@ es.
I'@@ ll give you some exam@@ pl@@ es of what mo@@ dern pro@@ gr@@ ess has made possi@@ ble for us@@ .
This is my su@@ per@@ mark@@ et. No@@ t su@@ ch a big on@@ e.
I want to say just a wor@@ d about s@@ al@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ing.
1@@ 7@@ 5 s@@ al@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ing@@ s in my su@@ per@@ mark@@ et, if you don't coun@@ t the 10 ex@@ tra@@ -@@ vir@@ g@@ in o@@ li@@ ve o@@ il@@ s and 1@@ 2 b@@ al@@ sam@@ ic v@@ in@@ eg@@ ar@@ s you could bu@@ y to make a very lar@@ ge num@@ ber of your own s@@ al@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ing@@ s, in the off@@ -@@ ch@@ ance that n@@ one of the 1@@ 7@@ 5 the stor@@ e has on off@@ er su@@ it you.
So this is what the su@@ per@@ mark@@ et is lik@@ e.
And then you go to the con@@ sum@@ er el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic@@ s stor@@ e to se@@ t up a ster@@ e@@ o system -- spe@@ ak@@ er@@ s, C@@ D pla@@ y@@ er, ta@@ pe pla@@ y@@ er, tun@@ er, am@@ p@@ lif@@ ier -- and in this one s@@ ing@@ le con@@ sum@@ er el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic@@ s stor@@ e, there are that many ster@@ e@@ o system@@ s.
We can con@@ stru@@ c@@ t si@@ x@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ hal@@ f@@ -@@ million different ster@@ e@@ o system@@ s out of the comp@@ on@@ ents that are on off@@ er in one stor@@ e.
Y@@ ou@@ 've got to ad@@ mit that's a lot of ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e.
In other d@@ om@@ ain@@ s -- the world of commun@@ ic@@ ation@@ s.
There was a time, when I was a bo@@ y, when you could get any kind of tel@@ e@@ ph@@ one ser@@ vi@@ ce you wan@@ te@@ d, as long as it came from M@@ a B@@ ell@@ .
You r@@ ent@@ ed your ph@@ on@@ e. You didn't bu@@ y it.
O@@ ne con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of that, by the way, is that the ph@@ one never b@@ ro@@ k@@ e.
And those da@@ ys are g@@ on@@ e.
We now have an al@@ most un@@ li@@ mit@@ ed v@@ ari@@ et@@ y of ph@@ on@@ es, es@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ ally in the world of c@@ ell ph@@ on@@ es.
Th@@ ese are c@@ ell ph@@ on@@ es of the f@@ ut@@ u@@ re.
M@@ y fa@@ vor@@ ite is the m@@ id@@ d@@ le one -- the M@@ P@@ 3 pla@@ y@@ er, no@@ se ha@@ ir tri@@ mm@@ er, and c@@ r@@ è@@ me br@@ û@@ l@@ é@@ e tor@@ ch.
And if by some ch@@ ance you ha@@ ven@@ 't se@@ en that in your stor@@ e y@@ et, you can res@@ t as@@ su@@ red that one day so@@ on, you wi@@ ll@@ .
And what this does is it le@@ ad@@ s people to w@@ alk into their stor@@ es as@@ king this ques@@ tion.
And do you know what the ans@@ wer to this ques@@ tion now is@@ ?
The ans@@ wer is "@@ no@@ ."
It is not possi@@ ble to bu@@ y a c@@ ell ph@@ one that doesn't do to@@ o mu@@ ch.
So, in other as@@ p@@ ec@@ ts of life that are much more s@@ ign@@ if@@ ic@@ ant than bu@@ ying thing@@ s, the same ex@@ pl@@ o@@ sion of ch@@ o@@ ice is tru@@ e.
H@@ e@@ al@@ th car@@ e. It is no l@@ on@@ ger the c@@ ase in the Un@@ ited St@@ at@@ es that you go to the do@@ c@@ tor@@ , and the do@@ c@@ t@@ or tell@@ s you what to do@@ .
In@@ ste@@ a@@ d, you go to the do@@ c@@ tor@@ , and the do@@ c@@ t@@ or tell@@ s you@@ , "@@ Well, we could do A@@ , or we could do B@@ .
A has these ben@@ ef@@ it@@ s, and these ris@@ k@@ s.
B has these ben@@ ef@@ it@@ s, and these ris@@ k@@ s. What do you want to do@@ ?"
And you say, "@@ D@@ oc@@ , what should I do@@ ?"
And the do@@ c sa@@ y@@ s, "@@ A has these ben@@ ef@@ its and ris@@ k@@ s, and B has these ben@@ ef@@ its and ris@@ k@@ s.
What do you want to do@@ ?"
And you say, "@@ If you were me, D@@ oc@@ , what would you do@@ ?"
And the do@@ c sa@@ y@@ s, "@@ But I'm not you@@ ."
And the res@@ ul@@ t is -- we c@@ all it "@@ p@@ ati@@ ent au@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ y@@ ," which ma@@ kes it so@@ und like a good thing@@ , but it really is a shi@@ f@@ ting of the b@@ ur@@ den and the res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ty for de@@ c@@ is@@ i@@ on@@ -@@ ma@@ king from som@@ eb@@ o@@ dy who kno@@ ws something -- nam@@ el@@ y, the do@@ c@@ t@@ or -- to som@@ eb@@ o@@ dy who kno@@ ws no@@ thing and is al@@ most cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly si@@ ck and th@@ us not in the bes@@ t s@@ ha@@ pe to be ma@@ king de@@ c@@ is@@ i@@ ons -- nam@@ el@@ y, the p@@ ati@@ ent.
Ther@@ e's en@@ or@@ m@@ ous mark@@ et@@ ing of pres@@ c@@ rip@@ tion d@@ ru@@ g@@ s to people like you and me, wh@@ ich, if you think about it, ma@@ kes no sen@@ se at all@@ , sin@@ ce we can't bu@@ y them.
Wh@@ y do they mark@@ et to us if we can't bu@@ y them@@ ?
The ans@@ wer is that they exp@@ ect us to c@@ all our do@@ c@@ tor@@ s the next mor@@ ning and as@@ k for our pres@@ c@@ rip@@ tions to be ch@@ an@@ ge@@ d.
S@@ om@@ e@@ thing as dr@@ am@@ ati@@ c as our id@@ ent@@ ity has now be@@ come a mat@@ ter of ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e, as this s@@ li@@ de is me@@ ant to in@@ dic@@ at@@ e.
We don't in@@ her@@ it an id@@ ent@@ it@@ y@@ ; we get to inv@@ ent it.
And we get to re@@ -@@ inv@@ ent our@@ sel@@ ves as of@@ ten as we lik@@ e.
And that me@@ ans that every da@@ y, when you wa@@ ke up in the mor@@ n@@ ing, you have to de@@ ci@@ de what kind of per@@ son you want to b@@ e.
W@@ it@@ h res@@ p@@ ect to mar@@ ri@@ age and fam@@ il@@ y, there was a time when the de@@ f@@ au@@ l@@ t ass@@ um@@ p@@ tion that al@@ most every@@ one had is that you got mar@@ ri@@ ed as so@@ on as you c@@ oul@@ d, and then you started ha@@ ving ki@@ ds as so@@ on as you c@@ oul@@ d.
The only real ch@@ o@@ ice was wh@@ o, not wh@@ en, and not what you did af@@ ter.
No@@ wa@@ da@@ y@@ s, every@@ thing is very much up for gr@@ ab@@ s.
I te@@ ach w@@ onder@@ ful@@ ly in@@ tel@@ li@@ gen@@ t stu@@ d@@ ent@@ s, and I ass@@ ign 20 percent l@@ ess work than I used to@@ .
And it's not because they're l@@ ess s@@ mar@@ t, and it's not because they're l@@ ess di@@ li@@ gen@@ t.
It's because they are pre@@ oc@@ c@@ up@@ ie@@ d, as@@ king them@@ sel@@ v@@ es, "@@ S@@ h@@ ould I get mar@@ ri@@ ed or no@@ t? S@@ h@@ ould I get mar@@ ri@@ ed no@@ w@@ ?
S@@ h@@ ould I get mar@@ ri@@ ed lat@@ er@@ ? S@@ h@@ ould I have ki@@ ds fir@@ st, or a car@@ e@@ er fir@@ st@@ ?"
Al@@ l of these are con@@ sum@@ ing ques@@ tion@@ s.
And they're going to ans@@ wer these ques@@ tion@@ s, wh@@ e@@ ther or not it me@@ ans not doing all the work I ass@@ ign and not get@@ ting a good gra@@ de in my cour@@ s@@ es.
And in@@ de@@ ed they sh@@ oul@@ d. Th@@ ese are import@@ ant ques@@ tions to ans@@ wer@@ .
Wor@@ k -- we are bl@@ es@@ se@@ d, as C@@ ar@@ l was poin@@ ting ou@@ t, with the technolog@@ y that en@@ ab@@ les us to work every min@@ u@@ te of every day from any plac@@ e on the plan@@ et -- ex@@ c@@ ep@@ t the R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h Ho@@ tel@@ .
There is one cor@@ n@@ er, by the way, that I'm not going to tell any@@ body ab@@ ou@@ t, where the W@@ i@@ F@@ i actually wor@@ k@@ s.
I'm not tell@@ ing you about it because I want to use it.
So what this me@@ an@@ s, this incre@@ di@@ ble fre@@ e@@ do@@ m of ch@@ o@@ ice we have with res@@ p@@ ect to wor@@ k, is that we have to make a de@@ c@@ is@@ i@@ on, ag@@ a@@ in and ag@@ a@@ in and again@@ , about wh@@ e@@ ther we should or sh@@ oul@@ dn't be wor@@ k@@ ing.
We can go to wat@@ ch our ki@@ d pla@@ y so@@ c@@ c@@ er, and we have our c@@ ell ph@@ one on one hi@@ p@@ , and our B@@ l@@ ack@@ ber@@ ry on our other hi@@ p@@ , and our l@@ ap@@ to@@ p@@ , pres@@ um@@ abl@@ y, on our l@@ ap@@ s.
And even if they're all sh@@ ut off@@ , every min@@ u@@ te that we're wat@@ ch@@ ing our ki@@ d mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ate a so@@ c@@ c@@ er g@@ am@@ e, we are also as@@ king our@@ sel@@ v@@ es, "@@ S@@ h@@ ould I ans@@ wer this c@@ ell ph@@ one call@@ ?
S@@ h@@ ould I res@@ p@@ on@@ d to this em@@ a@@ il@@ ? S@@ h@@ ould I d@@ ra@@ ft this l@@ et@@ ter@@ ?"
And even if the ans@@ wer to the ques@@ tion is "@@ no@@ ," it's cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly going to make the exper@@ i@@ ence of your k@@ id@@ 's so@@ c@@ c@@ er g@@ ame very different than it w@@ oul@@ d@@ 've be@@ en.
So every@@ where we loo@@ k, big things and sm@@ all thing@@ s, mat@@ eri@@ al things and lif@@ est@@ y@@ le thing@@ s, life is a mat@@ ter of ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e.
And the world we used to li@@ ve in loo@@ ked like this.
That is to say, there were some ch@@ o@@ ic@@ es, but not every@@ thing was a mat@@ ter of ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e.
And the world we now li@@ ve in loo@@ ks like this.
And the ques@@ tion is, is this good ne@@ w@@ s, or b@@ ad ne@@ w@@ s@@ ?
And the ans@@ wer is, "@@ y@@ es@@ ."
We all know wh@@ at's good about it, so I'm going to talk about wh@@ at's b@@ ad about it.
Al@@ l of this ch@@ o@@ ice has two eff@@ ec@@ t@@ s, two ne@@ g@@ ative eff@@ ec@@ ts on peopl@@ e.
O@@ ne eff@@ ec@@ t, par@@ a@@ do@@ x@@ ic@@ ally, is that it produc@@ es par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is, ra@@ ther than li@@ ber@@ ation.
W@@ it@@ h so many op@@ tions to ch@@ oo@@ se fro@@ m, people find it very di@@ ff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t to ch@@ oo@@ se at all@@ .
I'@@ ll give you one very dr@@ am@@ ati@@ c exam@@ ple of th@@ is@@ : a stu@@ dy that was d@@ one of inv@@ est@@ m@@ ents in vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment plan@@ s.
A col@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ e of m@@ ine got acc@@ ess to inv@@ est@@ ment rec@@ or@@ ds from V@@ ang@@ u@@ ar@@ d, the g@@ ig@@ an@@ ti@@ c m@@ ut@@ u@@ al@@ -@@ f@@ und comp@@ any of about a million em@@ pl@@ o@@ ye@@ es and about 2@@ ,000 different wor@@ k@@ plac@@ es.
And what she found is that for every 10 m@@ ut@@ u@@ al f@@ und@@ s the em@@ pl@@ o@@ y@@ er o@@ ffer@@ ed, r@@ ate of par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation went down two perc@@ ent.
You off@@ er 50 f@@ und@@ s -- 10 percent fe@@ wer em@@ pl@@ o@@ ye@@ es par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate than if you only off@@ er fi@@ ve. Wh@@ y@@ ?
Because with 50 f@@ und@@ s to ch@@ oo@@ se fro@@ m, it's so dam@@ n har@@ d to de@@ ci@@ de which f@@ und to ch@@ oo@@ se, that you@@ 'll just put it off un@@ ti@@ l t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w.
And then t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w, and t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w, and t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w, and of cour@@ se t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w never com@@ es.
Un@@ der@@ stand that not only does this me@@ an that people are going to have to e@@ at do@@ g foo@@ d when they re@@ ti@@ re because they don't have en@@ ough mon@@ ey put a@@ way, it also me@@ ans that ma@@ king the de@@ c@@ is@@ ion is so har@@ d that they pas@@ s up s@@ ign@@ if@@ ic@@ ant mat@@ ch@@ ing mon@@ ey from the em@@ pl@@ o@@ y@@ er.
B@@ y not par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ at@@ ing, they are pas@@ s@@ ing up as much as 5@@ ,000 d@@ ollar@@ s a ye@@ ar from the em@@ pl@@ o@@ y@@ er, who would happ@@ il@@ y mat@@ ch their con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion.
So par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is is a con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of ha@@ ving to@@ o many ch@@ o@@ ic@@ es.
And I think it ma@@ kes the world look like this. [@@ And la@@ st@@ ly, for all et@@ ern@@ ity, Fr@@ en@@ ch, ble@@ u ch@@ e@@ es@@ e, or ran@@ ch@@ ?@@ ] You really want to get the de@@ c@@ is@@ ion right if it's for all et@@ ern@@ ity, righ@@ t?
You don't want to pic@@ k the w@@ r@@ ong m@@ ut@@ u@@ al f@@ un@@ d, or the w@@ r@@ ong s@@ al@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ing.
So that's one eff@@ ec@@ t. The secon@@ d eff@@ ect is that even if we man@@ age to o@@ ver@@ come the par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is and make a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e, we end up l@@ ess s@@ at@@ is@@ fi@@ ed with the res@@ ul@@ t of the ch@@ o@@ ice than we would be if we had fe@@ wer op@@ tions to ch@@ oo@@ se fro@@ m.
And there are se@@ ver@@ al reas@@ ons for this.
is that with a lot of different s@@ al@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ing@@ s to ch@@ oo@@ se fro@@ m, if you bu@@ y on@@ e, and it's not per@@ f@@ ect -- and what s@@ al@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ing is@@ ? -- it's eas@@ y to imag@@ ine you could have made a different ch@@ o@@ ice that would have been bet@@ ter. And what happ@@ ens is this imag@@ in@@ ed al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative in@@ duc@@ es you to re@@ gre@@ t the de@@ c@@ is@@ ion you ma@@ de, and this re@@ gre@@ t sub@@ tr@@ ac@@ ts from the s@@ at@@ is@@ fac@@ tion you get out of the de@@ c@@ is@@ ion you ma@@ de,
even if it was a good de@@ c@@ is@@ i@@ on.
The more op@@ tions there ar@@ e, the eas@@ ier it is to re@@ gre@@ t any@@ thing at all that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting about the op@@ tion that you ch@@ o@@ se.
S@@ econ@@ d, what econ@@ om@@ ist@@ s c@@ all "@@ o@@ pp@@ ort@@ un@@ ity co@@ st@@ s@@ ."
D@@ an G@@ il@@ ber@@ t made a big poin@@ t this mor@@ ning of tal@@ king about how much the way in which we v@@ al@@ u@@ e things de@@ p@@ en@@ ds on what we comp@@ are them to@@ .
Well, when there are lo@@ ts of al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ves to con@@ si@@ der@@ , it is eas@@ y to imag@@ ine the at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tive fe@@ at@@ ur@@ es of al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ves that you re@@ jec@@ t that make you l@@ ess s@@ at@@ is@@ fi@@ ed with the al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative that you@@ 've ch@@ o@@ s@@ en.
Her@@ e's an exam@@ pl@@ e. [@@ I can't sto@@ p thin@@ king about those other av@@ a@@ il@@ able par@@ king spac@@ es on W 8@@ 5@@ th st@@ re@@ et@@ ] S@@ or@@ ry if you're not New Y@@ or@@ k@@ er@@ s.
Her@@ e's what you're su@@ p@@ pos@@ ed to be thin@@ k@@ ing.
Her@@ e's this c@@ ou@@ ple on the H@@ am@@ p@@ t@@ on@@ s.
Ver@@ y exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve real est@@ at@@ e.
G@@ or@@ ge@@ ous be@@ ach@@ . Be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful da@@ y. They have it all to them@@ sel@@ v@@ es.
What could be bet@@ ter@@ ?
"@@ Well, dam@@ n it@@ ," this gu@@ y is thin@@ k@@ ing, "@@ It's Au@@ gu@@ st. E@@ ver@@ y@@ body in my M@@ an@@ hat@@ t@@ an n@@ ei@@ gh@@ b@@ or@@ ho@@ od is a@@ wa@@ y.
I could be par@@ king right in fr@@ on@@ t of my build@@ ing@@ ."
And he sp@@ en@@ ds two we@@ ek@@ s n@@ ag@@ g@@ ed by the idea that he is mis@@ s@@ ing the o@@ pp@@ ort@@ un@@ ity, day after da@@ y, to have a great par@@ king spac@@ e.
sub@@ tr@@ ac@@ t from the s@@ at@@ is@@ fac@@ tion we get out of what we ch@@ oo@@ se, even when what we ch@@ oo@@ se is ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ic@@ .
And the more op@@ tions there are to con@@ si@@ der@@ , the more at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tive fe@@ at@@ ur@@ es of these op@@ tions are going to be re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ ted by us as o@@ pp@@ ort@@ un@@ ity co@@ st@@ s.
Her@@ e's another exam@@ pl@@ e.
Now this car@@ to@@ on ma@@ kes a lot of poin@@ ts.
It ma@@ kes poin@@ ts about li@@ ving in the m@@ om@@ ent as w@@ ell, and pro@@ bab@@ ly about doing things s@@ lo@@ w@@ l@@ y.
But one poin@@ t it ma@@ kes is that wh@@ en@@ ever you're ch@@ oo@@ s@@ ing one thing@@ , you're ch@@ oo@@ s@@ ing not to do other things that ma@@ y have lo@@ ts of at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tive fe@@ at@@ ur@@ es, and it's going to make what you're doing l@@ ess at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tiv@@ e.
Th@@ ir@@ d@@ : es@@ c@@ al@@ ation of exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ation@@ s.
This h@@ it me when I went to re@@ plac@@ e my je@@ an@@ s.
I we@@ ar je@@ ans al@@ most all the time.
There was a time when je@@ ans came in one fl@@ a@@ vor@@ , and you b@@ ou@@ ght them@@ , and they f@@ it like c@@ ra@@ p@@ , they were incre@@ di@@ b@@ ly un@@ com@@ for@@ t@@ abl@@ e, if you wor@@ e them and was@@ h@@ ed them en@@ ough tim@@ es, they started to fe@@ el OK@@ .
I went to re@@ plac@@ e my je@@ ans after years of we@@ ar@@ ing these old on@@ es, and I said, "@@ I want a pa@@ ir of je@@ an@@ s. Her@@ e's my si@@ z@@ e@@ ."
And the sho@@ p@@ ke@@ ep@@ er said, "@@ D@@ o you want s@@ li@@ m f@@ it, eas@@ y f@@ it, rel@@ a@@ x@@ ed f@@ it@@ ?
You want b@@ ut@@ t@@ on f@@ ly or zi@@ pp@@ er fl@@ y@@ ? You want st@@ on@@ e@@ was@@ h@@ ed or ac@@ id@@ -@@ was@@ he@@ d@@ ?
D@@ o you want them di@@ st@@ res@@ se@@ d@@ ?
You want bo@@ o@@ t c@@ u@@ t, ta@@ per@@ ed, bl@@ a@@ h bl@@ ah@@ ." O@@ n and on he wen@@ t.
M@@ y j@@ a@@ w dro@@ p@@ pe@@ d. And after I re@@ co@@ ver@@ ed, I said, "@@ I want the kind that used to be the only k@@ in@@ d@@ ."
He had no idea what that was, so I sp@@ ent an h@@ our tr@@ ying on all these dam@@ n je@@ an@@ s, and I wal@@ ked out of the stor@@ e -- tru@@ th@@ ! -- with the bes@@ t@@ -@@ f@@ it@@ ting je@@ ans I had ever ha@@ d.
I did bet@@ ter. Al@@ l this ch@@ o@@ ice made it possi@@ ble for me to do bet@@ ter.
But -- I f@@ el@@ t wor@@ se.
Wh@@ y@@ ? I w@@ ro@@ te a whole bo@@ ok to try to ex@@ pla@@ in this to m@@ y@@ self@@ .
The reas@@ on I f@@ el@@ t wor@@ se is that, with all of these op@@ tions av@@ a@@ il@@ abl@@ e, my exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations about how good a pa@@ ir of je@@ ans should be went up@@ .
I had very lo@@ w, no par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations when they only came in one fl@@ a@@ vor@@ .
When they came in 100 fl@@ a@@ vor@@ s, dam@@ n it, one of them sh@@ oul@@ d@@ 've been per@@ f@@ ec@@ t.
And what I got was go@@ o@@ d, but it was@@ n't per@@ f@@ ec@@ t.
And so I com@@ par@@ ed what I got to what I exp@@ ec@@ te@@ d, and what I got was dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting in com@@ par@@ is@@ on to what I exp@@ ec@@ te@@ d.
A@@ d@@ ding op@@ tions to peopl@@ e's li@@ ves can't hel@@ p but incre@@ ase the exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations people have about how good those op@@ tions will b@@ e.
And what that's going to pro@@ du@@ ce is l@@ ess s@@ at@@ is@@ fac@@ tion with res@@ ul@@ t@@ s, even when they're good res@@ ul@@ ts.
No@@ body in the world of mark@@ et@@ ing kno@@ ws this.
[@@ It all loo@@ ks so gre@@ at@@ . I can't wa@@ it to be dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ te@@ d@@ .@@ ] Because if they di@@ d, you w@@ oul@@ dn't all know what this was ab@@ ou@@ t.
The tr@@ ut@@ h is more like this.
[@@ E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing was bet@@ ter back when every@@ thing was wor@@ se@@ ] The reas@@ on that every@@ thing was bet@@ ter back when every@@ thing was wor@@ se is that when every@@ thing was wor@@ se, it was actually possi@@ ble for people to have exper@@ i@@ enc@@ es that were a pl@@ eas@@ ant sur@@ pr@@ is@@ e.
No@@ wa@@ da@@ y@@ s, the world we li@@ ve in -- we aff@@ lu@@ ent, in@@ du@@ stri@@ al@@ iz@@ ed c@@ iti@@ z@@ en@@ s, with per@@ f@@ ec@@ tion the exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ation -- the bes@@ t you can ever ho@@ pe for is that stu@@ f@@ f is as good as you exp@@ ect it to b@@ e.
You will never be pl@@ eas@@ ant@@ ly sur@@ pr@@ is@@ ed because your exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ation@@ s, my exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ation@@ s, have g@@ one through the ro@@ of@@ .
The s@@ ec@@ re@@ t to happ@@ in@@ ess -- this is what you all came for -- the s@@ ec@@ re@@ t to happ@@ in@@ ess is lo@@ w exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ation@@ s.
I want to say -- just a little au@@ to@@ bi@@ og@@ ra@@ ph@@ ical m@@ om@@ ent -- that I actually am mar@@ ri@@ ed to a wi@@ f@@ e, and sh@@ e's really qu@@ ite w@@ onder@@ ful@@ .
I c@@ oul@@ dn't have d@@ one bet@@ ter. I didn't s@@ et@@ tl@@ e.
But s@@ et@@ tl@@ ing is@@ n't al@@ ways su@@ ch a b@@ ad thing@@ .
F@@ in@@ ally -- O@@ ne con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of bu@@ ying a b@@ ad@@ -@@ f@@ it@@ ting pa@@ ir of je@@ ans when there is only one kind to bu@@ y is that when you are dis@@ s@@ at@@ is@@ f@@ ie@@ d, and you as@@ k wh@@ y, wh@@ o@@ 's res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ bl@@ e, the ans@@ wer is c@@ lear@@ : the world is res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ bl@@ e.
What could you do@@ ?
When there are h@@ und@@ re@@ ds of different st@@ y@@ les of je@@ ans av@@ a@@ il@@ abl@@ e, and you bu@@ y one that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ing, and you as@@ k wh@@ y, wh@@ o@@ 's res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ ble@@ ?
It is e@@ qu@@ ally c@@ le@@ ar that the ans@@ wer to the ques@@ tion is "@@ you@@ ."
You could have d@@ one bet@@ ter.
W@@ it@@ h a h@@ und@@ red different k@@ in@@ ds of je@@ ans on dis@@ pla@@ y, there is no ex@@ c@@ use for fa@@ il@@ u@@ re.
And so when people make de@@ c@@ is@@ i@@ on@@ s, and even th@@ ough the res@@ ul@@ ts of the de@@ c@@ is@@ i@@ ons are go@@ o@@ d, they fe@@ el dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted about them@@ ; they bl@@ ame them@@ sel@@ v@@ es.
C@@ lin@@ ical de@@ pres@@ sion has ex@@ pl@@ o@@ ded in the in@@ du@@ stri@@ al world in the last gener@@ ation.
I belie@@ ve a s@@ ign@@ if@@ ic@@ ant -- not the on@@ ly, but a s@@ ign@@ if@@ ic@@ ant -- con@@ tri@@ b@@ ut@@ or to this ex@@ pl@@ o@@ sion of de@@ pres@@ si@@ on, and also su@@ ic@@ i@@ de, is that people have exper@@ i@@ enc@@ es that are dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting because their stand@@ ar@@ ds are so h@@ igh@@ , and then when they have to ex@@ pla@@ in these exper@@ i@@ enc@@ es to them@@ sel@@ v@@ es, they think they're at f@@ au@@ l@@ t.
And so the net res@@ ul@@ t is that we do bet@@ ter in gener@@ al, ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y, and we fe@@ el wor@@ se.
So le@@ t me re@@ m@@ ind you.
This is the off@@ ic@@ i@@ al do@@ g@@ ma@@ , the one that we all take to be tru@@ e, and it's all f@@ al@@ se. It is not tru@@ e.
Ther@@ e's no ques@@ tion that some ch@@ o@@ ice is bet@@ ter than n@@ on@@ e, but it doesn't fol@@ lo@@ w from that that more ch@@ o@@ ice is bet@@ ter than some ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e.
Ther@@ e's some mag@@ ical am@@ oun@@ t. I don't know what it is.
I'm pre@@ tt@@ y con@@ fi@@ d@@ ent that we have long sin@@ ce pas@@ s@@ ed the poin@@ t where op@@ tions im@@ pro@@ ve our wel@@ f@@ ar@@ e.
Now, as a po@@ lic@@ y mat@@ ter -- I'm al@@ most d@@ one -- as a po@@ lic@@ y mat@@ ter, the thing to think about is th@@ is@@ : what en@@ ab@@ les all of this ch@@ o@@ ice in in@@ du@@ stri@@ al so@@ c@@ ie@@ ti@@ es is mat@@ eri@@ al aff@@ lu@@ enc@@ e.
There are lo@@ ts of plac@@ es in the worl@@ d, and we have hear@@ d about se@@ ver@@ al of them@@ , where their pro@@ blem is not that they have to@@ o much ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e.
Th@@ ei@@ r pro@@ blem is that they have to@@ o litt@@ l@@ e.
So the stu@@ f@@ f I'm tal@@ king about is the p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar pro@@ blem of mo@@ der@@ n, aff@@ lu@@ ent, W@@ es@@ tern so@@ c@@ ie@@ ti@@ es.
And what is so f@@ ru@@ str@@ ating and in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ating is th@@ is@@ : S@@ te@@ ve L@@ ev@@ it@@ t tal@@ ked to you y@@ es@@ ter@@ day about how these exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve and di@@ ff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ in@@ st@@ all ch@@ ild se@@ at@@ s don't hel@@ p@@ .
It's a wa@@ ste of mon@@ e@@ y.
What I'm tell@@ ing you is that these exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve, comp@@ lic@@ ated ch@@ o@@ ic@@ es -- it's not sim@@ pl@@ y that they don't hel@@ p@@ .
They actually h@@ ur@@ t.
They actually make us wor@@ se off@@ .
If some of what en@@ ab@@ les people in our so@@ c@@ ie@@ ti@@ es to make all of the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ es we make were shi@@ f@@ ted to so@@ c@@ ie@@ ti@@ es in which people have to@@ o few op@@ tion@@ s, not only would those peopl@@ e's li@@ ves be im@@ pro@@ v@@ ed, but our@@ s would be im@@ pro@@ ved al@@ so, which is what econ@@ om@@ ist@@ s c@@ all a "@@ Par@@ et@@ o@@ -@@ im@@ pro@@ ving mo@@ v@@ e@@ ."
In@@ come re@@ di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion will make every@@ one bet@@ ter off -- not just po@@ or people -- because of how all this ex@@ c@@ ess ch@@ o@@ ice pl@@ ag@@ u@@ es us@@ .
So to con@@ c@@ lu@@ de. [@@ You can be any@@ thing you want to be -- no li@@ mit@@ s@@ ] Y@@ ou@@ 're su@@ p@@ pos@@ ed to re@@ ad this car@@ to@@ on, and, being a so@@ ph@@ ist@@ ic@@ ated per@@ son@@ , say, "@@ A@@ h@@ ! What does this f@@ is@@ h kno@@ w@@ ?
You know, no@@ thing is possi@@ ble in this f@@ is@@ h@@ bo@@ w@@ l@@ ."
I@@ m@@ po@@ ver@@ is@@ h@@ ed imag@@ in@@ ation, a m@@ y@@ op@@ ic vie@@ w of the world -- and that's the way I re@@ ad it at fir@@ st.
The more I thought about it, ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , the more I came to the vie@@ w that this f@@ is@@ h kno@@ ws some@@ thing@@ .
Because the tr@@ ut@@ h of the mat@@ ter is that if you s@@ hat@@ ter the f@@ is@@ h@@ bo@@ w@@ l so that every@@ thing is possi@@ bl@@ e, you don't have fre@@ ed@@ om@@ . You have par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is.
If you s@@ hat@@ ter this f@@ is@@ h@@ bo@@ w@@ l so that every@@ thing is possi@@ bl@@ e, you de@@ cre@@ ase s@@ at@@ is@@ fac@@ tion.
You incre@@ ase par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is, and you de@@ cre@@ ase s@@ at@@ is@@ fac@@ tion.
E@@ ver@@ y@@ body ne@@ e@@ ds a f@@ is@@ h@@ bo@@ w@@ l@@ .
This one is al@@ most cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly to@@ o li@@ mit@@ ed -- per@@ ha@@ ps even for the f@@ is@@ h, cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly for us@@ .
But the ab@@ sen@@ ce of some m@@ et@@ ap@@ h@@ or@@ ical f@@ is@@ h@@ bo@@ w@@ l is a re@@ ci@@ pe for mis@@ er@@ y, and, I s@@ us@@ p@@ ec@@ t, dis@@ ast@@ er.
Thank you very mu@@ ch.
