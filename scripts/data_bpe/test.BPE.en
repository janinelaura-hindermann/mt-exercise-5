S@@ ever@@ al years ag@@ o here at TE@@ D@@ , P@@ et@@ er S@@ k@@ ill@@ man in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed a des@@ ign ch@@ all@@ enge called the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ all@@ o@@ w ch@@ all@@ eng@@ e.
And the ide@@ a@@ 's pre@@ tt@@ y sim@@ pl@@ e: Te@@ am@@ s of f@@ our have to bu@@ ild the t@@ all@@ est fre@@ e-@@ stand@@ ing stru@@ c@@ ture out of 20 st@@ ic@@ ks of sp@@ ag@@ h@@ et@@ ti@@ , one y@@ ar@@ d of ta@@ p@@ e, one y@@ ar@@ d of str@@ ing and a mar@@ sh@@ m@@ all@@ o@@ w.
The mar@@ sh@@ m@@ all@@ o@@ w has to be on to@@ p@@ .
An@@ d, th@@ ough it se@@ em@@ s really sim@@ pl@@ e, it's actually pre@@ tt@@ y har@@ d because it for@@ c@@ es people to c@@ oll@@ ab@@ or@@ ate very qu@@ ic@@ kl@@ y.
And so, I thought this was an interes@@ ting ide@@ a, and I in@@ cor@@ p@@ or@@ ated it into a des@@ ign wor@@ k@@ sho@@ p@@ .
And it was a h@@ u@@ ge su@@ c@@ c@@ es@@ s.
And sin@@ ce th@@ en, I've con@@ duc@@ ted about 7@@ 0 des@@ ign wor@@ k@@ sho@@ ps ac@@ ros@@ s the world with stu@@ d@@ ents and design@@ ers and ar@@ chit@@ ec@@ t@@ s, even the C@@ T@@ O@@ s of the F@@ ort@@ un@@ e 5@@ 0@@ , and there's something about this ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ e that re@@ v@@ e@@ als very de@@ ep l@@ ess@@ ons about the nat@@ ure of c@@ oll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation, and I'@@ d like to sh@@ are some of them with you.
So, nor@@ m@@ ally, most people beg@@ in by ori@@ ent@@ ing them@@ sel@@ ves to the t@@ as@@ k.
They talk about it, they f@@ ig@@ ure out what it's going to look lik@@ e, they j@@ o@@ ck@@ ey for po@@ wer@@ .
Th@@ en they sp@@ end some time pl@@ ann@@ ing, organ@@ iz@@ ing, they sk@@ et@@ ch and they la@@ y out sp@@ ag@@ h@@ et@@ ti@@ .
They sp@@ end the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of their time ass@@ em@@ bl@@ ing the st@@ ic@@ ks into ever@@ -@@ gro@@ wing stru@@ c@@ tur@@ es.
And then fin@@ ally, just as they're r@@ un@@ ning out of time, some@@ one ta@@ kes out the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ all@@ o@@ w, and then they g@@ ing@@ er@@ ly put it on to@@ p@@ , and then they stand bac@@ k, and -- ta@@ -@@ da@@ ! -- they ad@@ m@@ ir@@ e their wor@@ k.
But what really happen@@ s, most of the time, is that the "@@ ta@@ -@@ da@@ " tur@@ n@@ s into an "@@ u@@ h@@ -@@ oh@@ ," because the wei@@ ght of the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ all@@ o@@ w c@@ aus@@ es the enti@@ re stru@@ c@@ ture to bu@@ ck@@ le and to c@@ oll@@ ap@@ se.
So there are a num@@ ber of people who have a lot more "@@ u@@ h@@ -@@ oh@@ " m@@ om@@ ents than other@@ s, and am@@ ong the wor@@ st are rec@@ ent gra@@ du@@ at@@ es of b@@ us@@ in@@ ess sch@@ o@@ ol@@ .
They li@@ e, they ch@@ e@@ at@@ , they get di@@ str@@ ac@@ ted and they pro@@ du@@ ce really l@@ ame stru@@ c@@ tur@@ es.
And of cour@@ se there are te@@ am@@ s that have a lot more "@@ ta@@ -@@ da@@ " stru@@ c@@ tur@@ es, and am@@ ong the bes@@ t are rec@@ ent gra@@ du@@ at@@ es of k@@ in@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ t@@ en.
And it's pre@@ tt@@ y am@@ az@@ ing.
A@@ s P@@ et@@ er tell@@ s us@@ , not only do they pro@@ du@@ ce the t@@ all@@ est stru@@ c@@ tur@@ es, but they're the most interes@@ ting stru@@ c@@ tur@@ es of them all@@ .
So the ques@@ tion you want to as@@ k is@@ : How com@@ e? Wh@@ y@@ ? What is it about them@@ ?
And P@@ et@@ er lik@@ es to say that n@@ one of the ki@@ ds sp@@ end any time tr@@ ying to be C@@ E@@ O of Sp@@ ag@@ h@@ et@@ ti@@ , In@@ c@@ . R@@ igh@@ t?
They don't sp@@ end time j@@ o@@ ck@@ e@@ ying for po@@ wer@@ .
But there's another reas@@ on as w@@ ell@@ .
And the reas@@ on is that b@@ us@@ in@@ ess stu@@ d@@ ents are tra@@ in@@ ed to find the s@@ ing@@ le right pl@@ an, righ@@ t?
And then they ex@@ ec@@ u@@ te on it.
And then what happ@@ ens is, when they put the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ all@@ o@@ w on the to@@ p@@ , they ru@@ n out of time and what happ@@ ens@@ ?
It's a c@@ ris@@ is.
S@@ o@@ und fam@@ ili@@ ar@@ ? R@@ igh@@ t.
What k@@ in@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten@@ ers do differ@@ ent@@ ly is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ all@@ o@@ w, and they bu@@ ild pro@@ to@@ ty@@ p@@ es, su@@ c@@ c@@ es@@ si@@ ve pro@@ to@@ ty@@ p@@ es, al@@ ways ke@@ ep@@ ing the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ all@@ o@@ w on to@@ p@@ , so they have m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ple tim@@ es to fi@@ x when they bu@@ ild pro@@ to@@ ty@@ p@@ es al@@ ong the wa@@ y.
Des@@ ign@@ ers re@@ co@@ g@@ n@@ iz@@ e this ty@@ pe of c@@ oll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation as the ess@@ ence of the it@@ er@@ ative pro@@ c@@ es@@ s.
And with each ver@@ si@@ on, ki@@ ds get in@@ st@@ ant fe@@ ed@@ back about what wor@@ ks and what doesn't wor@@ k.
So the cap@@ ac@@ ity to pla@@ y in pro@@ to@@ ty@@ pe is really ess@@ enti@@ al, but l@@ et's look at how different te@@ am@@ s per@@ form@@ .
So the a@@ ver@@ age for most people is around 20 in@@ ch@@ es@@ ; b@@ us@@ in@@ ess sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s stu@@ d@@ ent@@ s, about hal@@ f of that@@ ; la@@ w@@ y@@ er@@ s, a little bet@@ ter, but not much bet@@ ter than that, k@@ in@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten@@ er@@ s, bet@@ ter than most ad@@ ul@@ ts.
Wh@@ o does the very bes@@ t?
Ar@@ chit@@ ec@@ ts and eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ s, th@@ ank@@ ful@@ l@@ y.
Th@@ ir@@ ty@@ -@@ n@@ ine in@@ ch@@ es is the t@@ all@@ est stru@@ c@@ ture I've se@@ en.
And why is it@@ ? Because they under@@ stand tri@@ ang@@ les and self@@ -@@ r@@ ein@@ for@@ c@@ ing ge@@ om@@ et@@ ri@@ c@@ al p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ s are the k@@ ey to build@@ ing st@@ able stru@@ c@@ tur@@ es.
So C@@ E@@ O@@ s, a little bit bet@@ ter than a@@ ver@@ ag@@ e, but her@@ e's where it get@@ s inter@@ est@@ ing.
If you put you put an ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive ad@@ min@@ . on the te@@ am@@ , they get s@@ ign@@ if@@ ic@@ ant@@ ly bet@@ ter.
It's incre@@ di@@ bl@@ e. You know, you look ar@@ oun@@ d, you go@@ , "@@ O@@ h, that te@@ am@@ 's going to win@@ ."
You can just tell befor@@ eh@@ an@@ d. And why is that@@ ?
Because they have spec@@ i@@ al sk@@ ill@@ s of fac@@ ili@@ t@@ ation.
They man@@ age the pro@@ c@@ es@@ s, they under@@ stand the pro@@ c@@ es@@ s.
And any te@@ am who man@@ ag@@ es and pa@@ ys c@@ lo@@ se at@@ ten@@ tion to work will s@@ ign@@ if@@ ic@@ ant@@ ly im@@ pro@@ ve the te@@ am@@ 's per@@ for@@ man@@ c@@ e.
Sp@@ ec@@ i@@ al@@ iz@@ ed sk@@ ill@@ s and fac@@ ili@@ t@@ ation sk@@ ill@@ s are the com@@ bin@@ ation that le@@ ad@@ s to str@@ ong su@@ c@@ c@@ es@@ s.
If you have 10 te@@ am@@ s that ty@@ pic@@ ally per@@ form@@ , you@@ 'll get ma@@ y@@ be si@@ x or so that have stand@@ ing stru@@ c@@ tur@@ es.
And I tri@@ ed something inter@@ est@@ ing.
I thou@@ gh@@ t, l@@ et's up the an@@ te, on@@ c@@ e.
So I o@@ ffer@@ ed a 1@@ 0@@ ,000 d@@ oll@@ ar pri@@ ze of so@@ ft@@ w@@ are to the w@@ inn@@ ing te@@ am@@ .
So what do you think happen@@ ed to these des@@ ign stu@@ d@@ ent@@ s@@ ?
What was the res@@ ul@@ t?
Her@@ e's what happen@@ ed@@ : No@@ t one te@@ am had a stand@@ ing stru@@ c@@ tu@@ re.
If any@@ one had bu@@ il@@ t, say, a one in@@ ch stru@@ c@@ tu@@ re, they would have ta@@ ken h@@ ome the pri@@ z@@ e.
So, is@@ n't that inter@@ est@@ ing@@ ? That h@@ ig@@ h st@@ ak@@ es have a str@@ ong imp@@ ac@@ t.
We did the ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ e ag@@ a@@ in with the same stu@@ d@@ ent@@ s.
What do you think happen@@ ed th@@ en?
So now they under@@ stand the v@@ al@@ u@@ e of pro@@ to@@ ty@@ p@@ ing.
So the same te@@ am went from being the very wor@@ st to being am@@ ong the very bes@@ t.
They produc@@ ed the t@@ all@@ est stru@@ c@@ tur@@ es in the le@@ ast am@@ oun@@ t of time.
So there's de@@ ep l@@ ess@@ ons for us about the nat@@ ure of in@@ c@@ enti@@ ves and su@@ c@@ c@@ es@@ s.
So, you might as@@ k@@ : Wh@@ y would any@@ one actually sp@@ end time w@@ rit@@ ing a mar@@ sh@@ m@@ all@@ o@@ w ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge@@ ?
And the reas@@ on is, I hel@@ p cre@@ ate dig@@ it@@ al to@@ ol@@ s and pro@@ c@@ ess@@ es to hel@@ p te@@ am@@ s bu@@ ild car@@ s and vi@@ de@@ o g@@ am@@ es and vis@@ u@@ al eff@@ ec@@ ts.
And what the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ all@@ o@@ w ch@@ all@@ enge does is it hel@@ ps them i@@ den@@ ti@@ f@@ y the hi@@ d@@ den ass@@ um@@ p@@ tion@@ s.
Bec@@ aus@@ e, f@@ ran@@ kl@@ y, every pro@@ jec@@ t has its own mar@@ sh@@ m@@ all@@ o@@ w, doesn't it@@ ?
The ch@@ all@@ enge pro@@ vi@@ des a sh@@ ar@@ ed exper@@ i@@ enc@@ e, a comm@@ on lang@@ u@@ ag@@ e, a comm@@ on st@@ ance to bu@@ ild the right pro@@ to@@ ty@@ p@@ e.
And so, this is the v@@ al@@ u@@ e of the exper@@ i@@ enc@@ e, of this so sim@@ ple ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ e.
And those of you who are interes@@ ted ma@@ y want to go to Mar@@ sh@@ m@@ all@@ o@@ w@@ Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge@@ .@@ com@@ .
It's a b@@ lo@@ g that you can look at how to bu@@ ild the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ all@@ o@@ w@@ s.
Ther@@ e's st@@ ep@@ -@@ b@@ y@@ -@@ ste@@ p in@@ stru@@ c@@ tions on this.
There are c@@ ra@@ z@@ y exam@@ pl@@ es from around the world of how people t@@ we@@ a@@ k and ad@@ just the system@@ .
Ther@@ e's world rec@@ or@@ ds that are on this as w@@ ell@@ .
And the f@@ und@@ am@@ ent@@ al l@@ ess@@ on, I belie@@ ve, is that des@@ ign tr@@ ul@@ y is a con@@ t@@ ac@@ t sp@@ or@@ t.
It de@@ m@@ and@@ s that we br@@ ing all of our sen@@ s@@ es to the t@@ as@@ k, and that we ap@@ pl@@ y the very bes@@ t of our thin@@ k@@ ing, our fe@@ el@@ ing and our doing to the ch@@ all@@ enge that we have at h@@ an@@ d.
And some@@ tim@@ es, a little pro@@ to@@ ty@@ pe of this exper@@ i@@ ence is all that it ta@@ kes to tur@@ n us from an "@@ u@@ h@@ -@@ oh@@ " m@@ om@@ ent to a "@@ ta@@ -@@ da@@ " m@@ om@@ ent.
And that can make a big differ@@ enc@@ e.
Thank you very mu@@ ch.
L@@ et's pre@@ ten@@ d right here we have a mach@@ in@@ e.
A big mach@@ in@@ e, a co@@ ol@@ , TE@@ D@@ -@@ is@@ h mach@@ in@@ e, and it's a time mach@@ in@@ e.
And every@@ one in this ro@@ om has to get into it.
And you can go bac@@ k@@ war@@ d@@ s, you can go for@@ war@@ d@@ s@@ ; you can@@ not st@@ a@@ y where you ar@@ e.
And I w@@ on@@ der what you@@ '@@ d ch@@ oo@@ se, because I've been as@@ king my fri@@ en@@ ds this ques@@ tion a lot lat@@ ely and they all want to go bac@@ k.
I don't kno@@ w. They want to go back befor@@ e there were au@@ t@@ om@@ ob@@ il@@ es or T@@ wit@@ ter or "@@ Americ@@ an I@@ d@@ ol@@ ."
I don't kno@@ w.
I'm con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed that there's some sort of pul@@ l to no@@ st@@ al@@ gi@@ a, to wis@@ h@@ ful thin@@ k@@ ing.
And I under@@ stand that.
I'm not part of that c@@ ro@@ w@@ d, I have to sa@@ y.
I don't want to go bac@@ k, and it's not because I'm ad@@ v@@ ent@@ ur@@ ou@@ s.
It's because possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ti@@ es on this plan@@ et, they don't go bac@@ k, they go for@@ war@@ d.
So I want to get in the mach@@ in@@ e, and I want to go for@@ war@@ d.
This is the gre@@ at@@ est time there's ever been on this plan@@ et by any me@@ as@@ ure that you wis@@ h to ch@@ oo@@ se@@ : he@@ al@@ th@@ , we@@ al@@ th@@ , mo@@ bi@@ li@@ t@@ y, o@@ pp@@ ort@@ un@@ ity, de@@ c@@ lin@@ ing rat@@ es of dis@@ eas@@ e ...
Ther@@ e's never been a time like this.
M@@ y gre@@ at@@ -@@ gr@@ and@@ par@@ ents di@@ ed, all of them@@ , by the time they were 6@@ 0@@ .
M@@ y gr@@ and@@ par@@ ents p@@ us@@ h@@ ed that num@@ ber to 7@@ 0@@ .
M@@ y par@@ ents are c@@ los@@ ing in on 8@@ 0@@ .
So there bet@@ ter be a n@@ ine at the beg@@ inn@@ ing of my de@@ at@@ h num@@ ber@@ .
But it's not even about people like us@@ , because this is a b@@ ig@@ ger de@@ al than that.
A ki@@ d b@@ or@@ n in New D@@ el@@ h@@ i to@@ day can exp@@ ect to li@@ ve as long as the rich@@ est man in the world did 100 years ag@@ o.
Th@@ in@@ k about that, it's an incre@@ di@@ ble fac@@ t.
And why is it tru@@ e?
S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x@@ . S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x k@@ ill@@ ed b@@ illi@@ ons of people on this plan@@ et.
It res@@ ha@@ p@@ ed the de@@ mo@@ gra@@ ph@@ y of the g@@ lo@@ be in a way that no war ever h@@ as@@ .
It's g@@ on@@ e. It's v@@ an@@ is@@ he@@ d.
We v@@ an@@ qu@@ is@@ h@@ ed it. P@@ u@@ ff@@ .
In the r@@ ich worl@@ d, dis@@ eas@@ es that thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed m@@ illi@@ ons of us just a gener@@ ation ag@@ o no l@@ on@@ ger ex@@ ist, har@@ d@@ l@@ y.
Di@@ ph@@ ther@@ i@@ a, ru@@ b@@ ell@@ a, poli@@ o ...
does any@@ one even know what those things ar@@ e?
V@@ acc@@ in@@ es, mo@@ dern me@@ dic@@ in@@ e, our ab@@ ili@@ ty to fe@@ ed b@@ illi@@ ons of peopl@@ e, those are tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s of the sci@@ enti@@ f@@ ic me@@ tho@@ d.
And to my min@@ d, the sci@@ enti@@ f@@ ic me@@ tho@@ d -- tr@@ ying stu@@ f@@ f ou@@ t, se@@ ein@@ g if it wor@@ k@@ s, chang@@ ing it when it doesn't -- is one of the great ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ m@@ ents of hum@@ an@@ ity.
So that's the good ne@@ w@@ s.
Un@@ for@@ tun@@ at@@ el@@ y, that's all the good ne@@ ws because there are some other problem@@ s, and they@@ 've been men@@ tion@@ ed many tim@@ es.
And one of them is that des@@ p@@ ite all our ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ment@@ s, a b@@ illion people go to b@@ ed h@@ ung@@ ry in this world every da@@ y.
That num@@ ber@@ 's ris@@ ing, and it's ris@@ ing really ra@@ p@@ id@@ ly, and it's dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul@@ .
And not only that, we've used our imag@@ in@@ ation to th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly tr@@ as@@ h this glob@@ e.
Po@@ t@@ able wat@@ er, ar@@ able lan@@ d, ra@@ in@@ for@@ est@@ s, o@@ il@@ , g@@ as@@ : they're going a@@ way, and they're going a@@ way so@@ on, and un@@ l@@ ess we in@@ no@@ v@@ ate our way out of this m@@ es@@ s, we're going a@@ way to@@ o.
So the ques@@ tion is@@ : C@@ an we do that@@ ? And I think we can@@ .
I think it's c@@ le@@ ar that we can make foo@@ d that will fe@@ ed b@@ illi@@ ons of people with@@ out ra@@ p@@ ing the l@@ and that they li@@ ve on.
I think we can po@@ wer this world with energ@@ y that doesn't also des@@ tro@@ y it.
I really do belie@@ ve that, and, no@@ , it ain@@ 't wis@@ h@@ ful thin@@ k@@ ing.
But her@@ e's the thing that ke@@ ep@@ s me up at n@@ ight -- one of the things that ke@@ ep@@ s me up at n@@ igh@@ t: We@@ 've never ne@@ ed@@ ed pro@@ gr@@ ess in sci@@ ence more than we need it right no@@ w. N@@ ever@@ .
And we've also never been in a pos@@ iti@@ on to de@@ pl@@ o@@ y it pro@@ per@@ ly in the way that we can to@@ da@@ y.
We@@ 're on the ver@@ ge of am@@ az@@ ing, am@@ az@@ ing ev@@ ents in many f@@ iel@@ d@@ s, and y@@ et I actually think we@@ '@@ d have to go back h@@ und@@ re@@ d@@ s, 3@@ 00 year@@ s, befor@@ e the En@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ men@@ t, to find a time when we b@@ at@@ tl@@ ed pro@@ gr@@ es@@ s, when we f@@ ou@@ ght about these things more v@@ ig@@ or@@ ous@@ ly, on more fr@@ on@@ t@@ s, than we do no@@ w.
P@@ e@@ o@@ ple w@@ ra@@ p them@@ sel@@ ves in their belie@@ f@@ s, and they do it so ti@@ gh@@ t@@ ly that you can't se@@ t them fre@@ e.
No@@ t even the tr@@ ut@@ h will se@@ t them fre@@ e.
An@@ d, li@@ st@@ en, every@@ on@@ e's ent@@ it@@ l@@ ed to their op@@ in@@ i@@ on@@ ; they're even ent@@ it@@ l@@ ed to their op@@ in@@ ion about pro@@ gr@@ es@@ s.
But you know what you're not ent@@ it@@ l@@ ed to@@ ?
Y@@ ou@@ 're not ent@@ it@@ l@@ ed to your own fac@@ ts. S@@ or@@ r@@ y, you're no@@ t.
And this to@@ ok me a@@ wh@@ ile to f@@ ig@@ ure ou@@ t.
Ab@@ out a de@@ c@@ ade ag@@ o, I w@@ ro@@ te a stor@@ y about v@@ acc@@ in@@ es for The New Y@@ or@@ k@@ er. A little stor@@ y.
And I was am@@ az@@ ed to find op@@ pos@@ iti@@ on@@ : op@@ pos@@ iti@@ on to what is, after all@@ , the most eff@@ ec@@ tive p@@ ub@@ li@@ c he@@ al@@ th me@@ as@@ ure in human h@@ ist@@ or@@ y.
I didn't know what to do@@ , so I just did what I do@@ : I w@@ ro@@ te a stor@@ y and I mo@@ ved on.
And so@@ on after that, I w@@ ro@@ te a stor@@ y about gen@@ e@@ tic@@ ally eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ed foo@@ d.
S@@ ame thing@@ , only b@@ ig@@ ger@@ .
P@@ e@@ o@@ ple were going c@@ ra@@ z@@ y.
So I w@@ ro@@ te a stor@@ y about that to@@ o, and I c@@ oul@@ dn't under@@ stand why people thought this was "@@ F@@ ran@@ k@@ en@@ foo@@ d@@ s@@ ," why they thought mo@@ ving m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ es around in a spec@@ if@@ ic@@ , ra@@ ther than a ha@@ p@@ ha@@ z@@ ar@@ d way, was tr@@ es@@ pas@@ s@@ ing on nat@@ u@@ re@@ 's gro@@ un@@ d.
Bu@@ t, you know, I do what I do@@ . I w@@ ro@@ te the stor@@ y, I mo@@ ved on.
I me@@ an, I'm a j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ ist.
We ty@@ p@@ e, we f@@ il@@ e, we go to d@@ inn@@ er. It's fin@@ e.
But these stor@@ ies bo@@ ther@@ ed me, and I c@@ oul@@ dn't f@@ ig@@ ure out wh@@ y, and ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally I di@@ d.
And that's because those fan@@ ati@@ c@@ s that were dri@@ ving me c@@ ra@@ z@@ y wer@@ en@@ 't actually fan@@ ati@@ c@@ s at all@@ .
They were thou@@ gh@@ t@@ ful peopl@@ e, e@@ duc@@ ated peopl@@ e, de@@ c@@ ent peopl@@ e.
They were ex@@ ac@@ t@@ ly like the people in this ro@@ om@@ .
And it just di@@ st@@ ur@@ b@@ ed me so mu@@ ch.
But then I thou@@ gh@@ t, you know, l@@ et's be h@@ on@@ es@@ t.
We@@ 're at a poin@@ t in this world where we don't have the same rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p to pro@@ gr@@ ess that we used to@@ .
We talk about it am@@ bi@@ v@@ al@@ ent@@ l@@ y.
We talk about it in ir@@ on@@ ic ter@@ m@@ s with little qu@@ o@@ tes around it@@ : "@@ pro@@ gr@@ ess@@ ."
O@@ ka@@ y, there are reas@@ ons for that, and I think we know what those reas@@ ons ar@@ e.
We@@ 've lo@@ st fa@@ it@@ h in in@@ st@@ itu@@ tion@@ s, in au@@ th@@ or@@ ity, and some@@ tim@@ es in sci@@ ence it@@ self@@ , and there's no reas@@ on we sh@@ oul@@ dn't ha@@ ve.
You can just say a few nam@@ es and people will under@@ st@@ an@@ d.
C@@ her@@ no@@ b@@ y@@ l@@ , B@@ ho@@ p@@ al, the Ch@@ all@@ eng@@ er, V@@ i@@ o@@ x@@ x@@ , we@@ ap@@ ons of m@@ as@@ s des@@ tru@@ c@@ tion, h@@ ang@@ ing ch@@ ad@@ s.
You know, you can ch@@ oo@@ se your li@@ st.
There are ques@@ tions and problem@@ s with the people we used to belie@@ ve were al@@ ways righ@@ t, so be sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ al.
A@@ s@@ k ques@@ tion@@ s, de@@ m@@ and pro@@ of@@ , de@@ m@@ and e@@ vi@@ den@@ c@@ e.
D@@ on@@ 't take any@@ thing for gr@@ an@@ te@@ d.
But her@@ e's the thing@@ : When you get pro@@ of@@ , you need to acc@@ ep@@ t the pro@@ of@@ , and we're not that good at doing that.
And the reas@@ on that I can say that is because we're now in an ep@@ ide@@ m@@ ic of fe@@ ar like one I've never se@@ en and ho@@ pe never to see again@@ .
Ab@@ out 1@@ 2 years ag@@ o, there was a stor@@ y p@@ ub@@ li@@ sh@@ ed, a h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble stor@@ y, that lin@@ ked the ep@@ ide@@ m@@ ic of au@@ t@@ is@@ m to the me@@ as@@ l@@ es, m@@ um@@ ps and ru@@ b@@ ell@@ a v@@ acc@@ ine sho@@ t.
Ver@@ y sc@@ ar@@ y.
T@@ ons of stu@@ dies were d@@ one to see if this was tru@@ e.
T@@ ons of stu@@ dies should have been don@@ e@@ ; it's a ser@@ i@@ ous is@@ su@@ e.
The dat@@ a came bac@@ k.
The dat@@ a came back from the Un@@ ited St@@ at@@ es, from En@@ gl@@ and, from S@@ we@@ den, from C@@ an@@ a@@ da@@ , and it was all the sam@@ e: no cor@@ rel@@ ation, no con@@ nec@@ tion, n@@ one at all@@ .
It doesn't mat@@ ter. It doesn't mat@@ ter because we belie@@ ve an@@ ec@@ do@@ t@@ es, we belie@@ ve what we se@@ e, what we think we se@@ e, what ma@@ kes us fe@@ el re@@ al.
We don't belie@@ ve a b@@ un@@ ch of do@@ c@@ um@@ ents from a go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment off@@ ic@@ i@@ al gi@@ ving us dat@@ a, and I do under@@ stand that, I think we all do@@ .
But you know wh@@ at@@ ?
The res@@ ul@@ t of that has been dis@@ a@@ str@@ ou@@ s.
D@@ is@@ a@@ str@@ ous because her@@ e's a fac@@ t: The Un@@ ited St@@ at@@ es is one of the only coun@@ tri@@ es in the world where the v@@ acc@@ ine r@@ ate for me@@ as@@ les is going do@@ w@@ n.
That is dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul@@ , and we should be as@@ h@@ am@@ ed of our@@ sel@@ v@@ es.
It's h@@ or@@ ri@@ bl@@ e.
What kind of a thing happen@@ ed that we could do that@@ ?
Now, I under@@ stand it. I do under@@ stand it.
Bec@@ aus@@ e, did any@@ one have me@@ as@@ les her@@ e?
H@@ as one per@@ son in this au@@ di@@ ence ever se@@ en some@@ one die of me@@ as@@ l@@ es@@ ?
D@@ o@@ es@@ n't happ@@ en very mu@@ ch.
D@@ o@@ es@@ n't happ@@ en in this coun@@ try at all@@ , but it happen@@ ed 1@@ 6@@ 0@@ ,000 tim@@ es in the world last year@@ .
That's a lot of de@@ at@@ h of me@@ as@@ les -- 20 an h@@ our@@ .
But sin@@ ce it didn't happ@@ en here, we can put it out of our min@@ d@@ s, and people like J@@ enn@@ y M@@ c@@ C@@ ar@@ th@@ y can go around pre@@ ach@@ ing m@@ es@@ sag@@ es of fe@@ ar and illi@@ ter@@ ac@@ y from pl@@ at@@ form@@ s like "@@ O@@ p@@ ra@@ h@@ " and "@@ L@@ ar@@ ry K@@ ing Li@@ v@@ e@@ ."
And they can do it because they don't lin@@ k c@@ aus@@ ation and cor@@ rel@@ ation.
They don't under@@ stand that these things se@@ em the sam@@ e, but they're al@@ most never the sam@@ e.
And it's something we need to lear@@ n, and we need to lear@@ n it really so@@ on.
This gu@@ y was a her@@ o, J@@ on@@ as S@@ al@@ k.
He to@@ ok one of the wor@@ st sc@@ our@@ g@@ es of man@@ kind a@@ way from us@@ .
N@@ o f@@ ear@@ , no ag@@ on@@ y. Po@@ li@@ o -- p@@ u@@ ff@@ , g@@ on@@ e.
That gu@@ y in the m@@ id@@ d@@ l@@ e, not so mu@@ ch.
H@@ is n@@ ame is P@@ au@@ l O@@ ff@@ it.
He just devel@@ op@@ ed a ro@@ ta@@ vi@@ ru@@ s v@@ acc@@ ine with a b@@ un@@ ch of other peopl@@ e.
It@@ 'll sa@@ ve the li@@ ves of 4@@ 00 to 5@@ 00@@ ,000 ki@@ ds in the devel@@ op@@ ing world every year@@ .
P@@ re@@ tt@@ y go@@ o@@ d, righ@@ t?
Well, it's go@@ o@@ d, ex@@ c@@ ep@@ t that P@@ au@@ l go@@ es around tal@@ king about v@@ acc@@ in@@ es and sa@@ ys how v@@ al@@ u@@ able they are and that people ou@@ ght to just sto@@ p the wh@@ in@@ ing.
And he actually sa@@ ys it that wa@@ y.
So, P@@ au@@ l@@ 's a ter@@ r@@ or@@ ist.
When P@@ au@@ l spe@@ ak@@ s in a p@@ ub@@ li@@ c hear@@ ing, he can't t@@ es@@ ti@@ f@@ y with@@ out ar@@ m@@ ed gu@@ ar@@ d@@ s.
He get@@ s called at h@@ ome because people like to tell hi@@ m that they re@@ mem@@ ber where his ki@@ ds go to sch@@ o@@ ol@@ .
And wh@@ y@@ ? Because P@@ au@@ l made a v@@ acc@@ in@@ e.
I don't need to say this, but v@@ acc@@ in@@ es are ess@@ enti@@ al.
You take them a@@ way, dis@@ eas@@ e comes bac@@ k, h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble dis@@ eas@@ es. And that's happen@@ ing.
We have me@@ as@@ les in this coun@@ try no@@ w.
And it's get@@ ting wor@@ se, and pre@@ tt@@ y so@@ on ki@@ ds are going to die of it ag@@ a@@ in because it's just a num@@ ber@@ s g@@ am@@ e.
And they're not just going to die of me@@ as@@ l@@ es.
What about poli@@ o@@ ? L@@ et's have that. Wh@@ y no@@ t?
A col@@ le@@ ge c@@ las@@ sm@@ ate of m@@ ine w@@ ro@@ te me a c@@ ou@@ ple we@@ ek@@ s ag@@ o and said she thought I was a little stri@@ den@@ t.
N@@ o on@@ e's ever said that befor@@ e.
S@@ he was@@ n't going to v@@ acc@@ in@@ ate her ki@@ d again@@ st poli@@ o, no wa@@ y.
F@@ in@@ e.
Wh@@ y@@ ? Because we don't have poli@@ o. And you know wh@@ at@@ ?
We didn't have poli@@ o in this coun@@ try y@@ es@@ ter@@ da@@ y.
T@@ o@@ da@@ y, I don't know, ma@@ y@@ be a gu@@ y got on a plan@@ e in L@@ ag@@ o@@ s this mor@@ n@@ ing, and h@@ e's fl@@ ying to L@@ A@@ X@@ , right now h@@ e's over O@@ hi@@ o.
And h@@ e's going to l@@ and in a c@@ ou@@ ple of h@@ our@@ s, h@@ e's going to r@@ ent a car@@ , and h@@ e's going to come to L@@ ong Be@@ ach@@ , and h@@ e's going to at@@ ten@@ d one of these f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous TED d@@ inn@@ ers t@@ on@@ igh@@ t.
And he doesn't know that h@@ e's in@@ f@@ ec@@ ted with a par@@ al@@ y@@ ti@@ c dis@@ eas@@ e, and we don't ei@@ ther because that's the way the world wor@@ k@@ s.
That's the plan@@ et we li@@ ve on. D@@ on@@ 't pre@@ ten@@ d it is@@ n@@ '@@ t.
Now, we lo@@ ve to w@@ ra@@ p our@@ sel@@ ves in li@@ es. We lo@@ ve to do it.
E@@ ver@@ y@@ one take their v@@ it@@ am@@ ins this mor@@ n@@ ing@@ ?
E@@ ch@@ in@@ ac@@ e@@ a, a little an@@ ti@@ o@@ x@@ id@@ ant to get you go@@ ing.
I know you did because hal@@ f of Americ@@ ans do every da@@ y.
They take the stu@@ ff@@ , and they take al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative me@@ dic@@ in@@ es, and it doesn't mat@@ ter how of@@ ten we find out that they're us@@ el@@ es@@ s.
The dat@@ a sa@@ ys it all the time.
They dar@@ ken your ur@@ in@@ e. They al@@ most never do more than that.
It's ok@@ a@@ y, you want to pa@@ y 2@@ 8 b@@ illion d@@ ollar@@ s for dar@@ k ur@@ in@@ e?
I'm to@@ t@@ ally with you.
D@@ ar@@ k ur@@ in@@ e. D@@ ar@@ k.
Wh@@ y do we do that@@ ? Wh@@ y do we do that@@ ?
Well, I think I under@@ st@@ and, we hat@@ e Bi@@ g P@@ har@@ ma@@ .
We hat@@ e Bi@@ g Go@@ ver@@ n@@ men@@ t. We don't tr@@ ust the M@@ an.
And we sh@@ oul@@ d@@ n@@ '@@ t: O@@ ur he@@ al@@ th c@@ are system su@@ ck@@ s.
It's c@@ ru@@ el to m@@ illi@@ ons of peopl@@ e.
It's ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing@@ ly c@@ old and s@@ oul@@ -@@ ben@@ ding to those of us who can even aff@@ or@@ d it.
So we ru@@ n a@@ way from it, and where do we r@@ un@@ ?
We le@@ a@@ p into the ar@@ m@@ s of Bi@@ g P@@ l@@ ac@@ eb@@ o.
That's fan@@ ta@@ st@@ ic@@ . I lo@@ ve Bi@@ g P@@ l@@ ac@@ eb@@ o.
Bu@@ t, you know, it's really a ser@@ i@@ ous thing because this stu@@ f@@ f is c@@ ra@@ p@@ , and we sp@@ end b@@ illi@@ ons of d@@ ollar@@ s on it.
And I have all sor@@ ts of little pro@@ ps here.
N@@ one of it ... g@@ in@@ k@@ go@@ , fr@@ au@@ d@@ ; e@@ ch@@ in@@ ac@@ e@@ a, fr@@ au@@ d@@ ; ac@@ a@@ i -- I don't even know what that is but we're sp@@ end@@ ing b@@ illi@@ ons of d@@ ollar@@ s on it -- it's fr@@ au@@ d.
And you know wh@@ at@@ ? When I say this stu@@ ff@@ , people s@@ cre@@ am at me, and they say, "@@ What do you car@@ e? L@@ et people do what they want to do@@ .
It ma@@ kes them fe@@ el go@@ o@@ d@@ ."
And you know wh@@ at@@ ? Y@@ ou@@ 're w@@ r@@ ong@@ .
Because I don't c@@ are if it's the s@@ ec@@ re@@ t@@ ary of H@@ H@@ S wh@@ o@@ 's sa@@ y@@ ing, "@@ H@@ m@@ m, I'm not going to take the e@@ vi@@ den@@ ce of my exper@@ ts on m@@ am@@ mo@@ gr@@ am@@ s@@ ," or some can@@ c@@ er qu@@ ack who wan@@ ts to tre@@ at his p@@ ati@@ ent with co@@ ff@@ e@@ e en@@ em@@ as@@ .
When you start down the ro@@ ad where belie@@ f and mag@@ ic re@@ plac@@ e e@@ vi@@ den@@ ce and sci@@ enc@@ e, you end up in a plac@@ e you don't want to b@@ e.
You end up in Th@@ ab@@ o M@@ be@@ k@@ i S@@ ou@@ th Afric@@ a.
He k@@ ill@@ ed 4@@ 00@@ ,000 of his people by in@@ si@@ st@@ ing that be@@ et@@ ro@@ o@@ t, g@@ ar@@ li@@ c and l@@ em@@ on o@@ il were much more eff@@ ec@@ tive than the an@@ ti@@ re@@ tro@@ vir@@ al d@@ ru@@ g@@ s we know can s@@ lo@@ w the cour@@ se of A@@ I@@ D@@ S@@ .
H@@ und@@ re@@ ds of thou@@ s@@ and@@ s of ne@@ ed@@ l@@ ess de@@ a@@ th@@ s in a coun@@ try that has been pl@@ ag@@ u@@ ed wor@@ se than any other by this dis@@ eas@@ e.
P@@ le@@ as@@ e, don't tell me there are no con@@ se@@ qu@@ enc@@ es to these thing@@ s.
There ar@@ e. There al@@ ways ar@@ e.
Now, the most min@@ d@@ l@@ ess ep@@ ide@@ m@@ ic we're in the m@@ id@@ d@@ le of right now is this ab@@ sur@@ d b@@ at@@ t@@ le between pro@@ p@@ on@@ ents of gen@@ e@@ tic@@ ally eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ed foo@@ d and the organ@@ ic el@@ it@@ e.
It's an i@@ di@@ o@@ ti@@ c de@@ b@@ at@@ e. It has to st@@ op@@ .
It's a de@@ b@@ ate about wor@@ d@@ s, about m@@ et@@ ap@@ h@@ or@@ s.
It's ide@@ olog@@ y, it's not sci@@ enc@@ e.
E@@ very s@@ ing@@ le thing we e@@ at@@ , every gra@@ in of ri@@ c@@ e, every sp@@ ri@@ g of par@@ s@@ le@@ y, every B@@ r@@ us@@ sel@@ s sp@@ r@@ out has been mo@@ di@@ fi@@ ed by man@@ .
You know, there wer@@ en@@ 't t@@ ang@@ er@@ in@@ es in the g@@ ar@@ den of E@@ d@@ en.
There was@@ n't any can@@ tal@@ ou@@ p@@ e. There wer@@ en@@ 't Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as tre@@ es. We made it all@@ .
We made it over the last 1@@ 1@@ ,000 year@@ s.
And some of it wor@@ k@@ ed, and some of it di@@ d@@ n@@ '@@ t.
We got ri@@ d of the stu@@ f@@ f that di@@ d@@ n@@ '@@ t.
Now we can do it in a more pre@@ c@@ is@@ e way -- and there are ris@@ k@@ s, ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely -- but we can put something like v@@ it@@ am@@ in A into ri@@ c@@ e, and that stu@@ f@@ f can hel@@ p m@@ illi@@ ons of peopl@@ e, m@@ illi@@ ons of peopl@@ e, pro@@ long their li@@ v@@ es.
You don't want to do that@@ ?
I have to say, I don't under@@ stand it.
We ob@@ jec@@ t to gen@@ e@@ tic@@ ally eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ed foo@@ d.
Wh@@ y do we do that@@ ?
Well, the things I con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly he@@ ar ar@@ e: T@@ o@@ o many ch@@ em@@ ic@@ al@@ s, p@@ es@@ ti@@ ci@@ d@@ es, h@@ or@@ mon@@ es, mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tu@@ re, we don't want gi@@ ant f@@ iel@@ ds of the same thing@@ , that's w@@ r@@ ong@@ .
We don't comp@@ an@@ ies p@@ at@@ ent@@ ing lif@@ e.
We don't want comp@@ an@@ ies o@@ w@@ ning se@@ ed@@ s.
And you know what my res@@ p@@ on@@ se to all of that is@@ ?
Y@@ es, you're righ@@ t. L@@ et's fi@@ x it.
It's tru@@ e, we've got a h@@ u@@ ge foo@@ d problem@@ , but this is@@ n't sci@@ enc@@ e.
This has no@@ thing to do with sci@@ enc@@ e.
It's la@@ w, it's mor@@ al@@ ity, it's p@@ at@@ ent stu@@ ff@@ .
You know sci@@ ence is@@ n't a comp@@ an@@ y.
It's not a coun@@ tr@@ y.
It's not even an ide@@ a@@ ; it's a pro@@ c@@ es@@ s.
It's a pro@@ c@@ es@@ s, and some@@ tim@@ es it wor@@ ks and some@@ tim@@ es it do@@ es@@ n@@ '@@ t, but the idea that we should not all@@ o@@ w sci@@ ence to do its j@@ ob because we're af@@ ra@@ i@@ d, is really very de@@ a@@ den@@ ing, and it's pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing m@@ illi@@ ons of people from pro@@ sp@@ er@@ ing.
You know, in the next 50 years we're going to have to gro@@ w 7@@ 0 percent more foo@@ d than we do right no@@ w, 7@@ 0 perc@@ ent.
This inv@@ est@@ ment in Afric@@ a over the last 3@@ 0 year@@ s.
D@@ is@@ gr@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul@@ . D@@ is@@ gr@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul@@ .
They need it, and we're not gi@@ ving it to them.
And wh@@ y@@ ? Gen@@ e@@ tic@@ ally eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ed foo@@ d.
We don't want to enc@@ our@@ age people to e@@ at that ro@@ t@@ ten stu@@ ff@@ , like c@@ as@@ sa@@ v@@ a for in@@ st@@ anc@@ e.
C@@ as@@ sa@@ v@@ a@@ 's something that hal@@ f a b@@ illion people e@@ at@@ .
It's kind of like a po@@ t@@ at@@ o.
It's just a b@@ un@@ ch of c@@ al@@ ori@@ es. It su@@ ck@@ s.
It doesn't have n@@ ut@@ ri@@ ent@@ s, it doesn't have pro@@ t@@ ein@@ , and sci@@ enti@@ st@@ s are eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing all of that into it right no@@ w.
And then people would be able to e@@ at it and they@@ '@@ d be able to not go bl@@ in@@ d.
They w@@ oul@@ dn't star@@ ve, and you know wh@@ at@@ ?
That would be n@@ ic@@ e. It w@@ oul@@ dn't be C@@ he@@ z P@@ an@@ is@@ se, but it would be n@@ ic@@ e.
And all I can say about this is@@ : Wh@@ y are we f@@ igh@@ ting it@@ ?
I me@@ an, l@@ et's as@@ k our@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ : Wh@@ y are we f@@ igh@@ ting it@@ ?
Because we don't want to mo@@ ve gen@@ es ar@@ o@@ und@@ ?
This is about mo@@ ving gen@@ es ar@@ oun@@ d. It's not about ch@@ em@@ ic@@ al@@ s.
It's not about our ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous passi@@ on for h@@ or@@ mon@@ es, our in@@ si@@ st@@ ence on ha@@ ving b@@ ig@@ ger foo@@ d, bet@@ ter foo@@ d, s@@ ing@@ ul@@ ar foo@@ d.
This is@@ n't about R@@ ice K@@ ris@@ pi@@ es, this is about ke@@ ep@@ ing people ali@@ ve, and it's about time we started to under@@ stand what that me@@ an@@ t.
Bec@@ aus@@ e, you know some@@ thing@@ ?
If we don@@ '@@ t, if we con@@ tin@@ u@@ e to ac@@ t the way we're ac@@ t@@ ing, we're gu@@ il@@ ty of something that I don't think we want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of@@ : h@@ igh@@ -@@ te@@ ch col@@ on@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ m.
Ther@@ e's no other way to des@@ c@@ ri@@ be wh@@ at's going on here.
It's self@@ is@@ h, it's u@@ gl@@ y, it's ben@@ e@@ at@@ h us@@ , and we really have to sto@@ p it.
So after this am@@ az@@ ing@@ ly fu@@ n con@@ vers@@ ation, you might want to say, "@@ So, you still want to get in this ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous time mach@@ ine and go for@@ war@@ d@@ ?"
Ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ el@@ y. Ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ el@@ y, I do@@ .
It's stu@@ ck in the pres@@ ent right no@@ w, but we have an am@@ az@@ ing o@@ pp@@ ort@@ un@@ ity.
We can se@@ t that time mach@@ ine on any@@ thing we wan@@ t.
We can mo@@ ve it where we want to mo@@ ve it, and we're going to mo@@ ve it where we want to mo@@ ve it.
We have to have these con@@ vers@@ ations and we have to thin@@ k, but when we get in the time mach@@ ine and we go ah@@ e@@ a@@ d, we're going to be happ@@ y we do@@ .
I know that we c@@ an, and as f@@ ar as I'm con@@ cer@@ ne@@ d, that's something the world ne@@ e@@ ds right no@@ w.
Thank you.
O@@ ne da@@ y, L@@ o@@ s An@@ gel@@ es T@@ im@@ es col@@ um@@ n@@ ist S@@ te@@ ve L@@ o@@ pe@@ z was wal@@ king al@@ ong the st@@ re@@ et@@ s of do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn L@@ o@@ s An@@ gel@@ es when he hear@@ d be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful mus@@ ic@@ .
And the s@@ our@@ ce was a man@@ , an Afri@@ can@@ -@@ Americ@@ an man@@ , ch@@ ar@@ m@@ ing, ru@@ g@@ ge@@ d, h@@ om@@ el@@ es@@ s, pla@@ ying a vi@@ o@@ li@@ n that only had two str@@ ing@@ s.
And I'm tell@@ ing a stor@@ y that many of you know, because S@@ te@@ v@@ e's col@@ um@@ n@@ s bec@@ ame the bas@@ is for a bo@@ o@@ k, which was tur@@ n@@ ed into a mo@@ vi@@ e, with Ro@@ ber@@ t D@@ o@@ w@@ ne@@ y J@@ r@@ . ac@@ ting as S@@ te@@ ve L@@ o@@ pe@@ z@@ , and J@@ am@@ ie Fo@@ x@@ x as N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ ie@@ l An@@ th@@ on@@ y A@@ y@@ er@@ s, the J@@ u@@ illi@@ ar@@ d@@ -@@ tra@@ in@@ ed d@@ ou@@ ble b@@ ass@@ ist wh@@ o@@ se pro@@ mis@@ ing car@@ e@@ er was c@@ ut sh@@ ort by a tr@@ ag@@ ic aff@@ lic@@ tion with par@@ an@@ o@@ i@@ d sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ i@@ a.
N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ ie@@ l dro@@ pp@@ ed out of J@@ u@@ illi@@ ar@@ d, he su@@ ffer@@ ed a compl@@ ete bre@@ ak@@ do@@ w@@ n, and 3@@ 0 years lat@@ er he was li@@ ving h@@ om@@ el@@ ess on the st@@ re@@ et@@ s of S@@ ki@@ d Ro@@ w in do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn L@@ o@@ s An@@ gel@@ es.
I enc@@ our@@ age all of you to re@@ ad S@@ te@@ v@@ e's bo@@ ok or to wat@@ ch the mo@@ v@@ ie to under@@ stand not only the be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful b@@ on@@ d that form@@ ed between these two m@@ en, but how mus@@ ic hel@@ p@@ ed s@@ ha@@ pe that b@@ on@@ d, and ul@@ tim@@ at@@ ely was in@@ str@@ um@@ ent@@ al -- if you@@ 'll par@@ d@@ on the p@@ u@@ n -- in hel@@ p@@ ing N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ ie@@ l get off the st@@ re@@ et@@ s.
I me@@ t M@@ r@@ . A@@ y@@ ers in 200@@ 8@@ , two years ag@@ o, at W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y C@@ on@@ c@@ ert H@@ all@@ .
He had just hear@@ d a per@@ for@@ man@@ ce of Be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven@@ 's F@@ ir@@ st and F@@ our@@ th sy@@ m@@ ph@@ on@@ i@@ es, and came bac@@ k@@ st@@ age and in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed h@@ im@@ self@@ .
He was spe@@ a@@ king in a very j@@ o@@ vi@@ al and gre@@ g@@ ari@@ ous way about Y@@ o@@ -@@ Y@@ o M@@ a and H@@ ill@@ ary C@@ lin@@ t@@ on and how the D@@ o@@ d@@ ger@@ s were never going to make the Wor@@ ld S@@ eri@@ es, all because of the tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous first vi@@ o@@ li@@ n pas@@ sag@@ e work in the last mo@@ v@@ em@@ ent of Be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven@@ 's F@@ our@@ th Sy@@ m@@ ph@@ on@@ y.
And we got tal@@ king about mus@@ ic@@ , and I got an em@@ a@@ il from S@@ te@@ ve a few da@@ ys lat@@ er sa@@ ying that N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ ie@@ l was interes@@ ted in a vi@@ o@@ li@@ n l@@ ess@@ on with m@@ e.
Now, I should men@@ tion that N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ ie@@ l re@@ f@@ us@@ es tre@@ at@@ ment because when he was tre@@ ated it was with sho@@ ck ther@@ ap@@ y and Th@@ or@@ az@@ ine and h@@ and@@ c@@ u@@ ff@@ s, and that sc@@ ar has st@@ a@@ y@@ ed with hi@@ m for his enti@@ re lif@@ e.
But as a res@@ ul@@ t no@@ w, he is pr@@ one to these sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic ep@@ is@@ o@@ d@@ es, the wor@@ st of which can man@@ if@@ est them@@ sel@@ ves as hi@@ m ex@@ pl@@ o@@ ding and then dis@@ ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ing for da@@ y@@ s, w@@ ander@@ ing the st@@ re@@ et@@ s of S@@ ki@@ d Ro@@ w, ex@@ pos@@ ed to its h@@ or@@ r@@ or@@ s, with the tor@@ ment of his own m@@ ind un@@ le@@ as@@ h@@ ed up@@ on h@@ im@@ .
And N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ ie@@ l was in su@@ ch a st@@ ate of ag@@ it@@ ation when we started our first l@@ ess@@ on at W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y C@@ on@@ c@@ ert H@@ all -- he had a kind of man@@ ic gl@@ in@@ t in his ey@@ es, he was lo@@ st.
And he was tal@@ king about inv@@ is@@ i@@ ble de@@ mon@@ s and s@@ mo@@ k@@ e, and how some@@ one was po@@ is@@ on@@ ing hi@@ m in his s@@ le@@ ep@@ .
And I was af@@ ra@@ i@@ d, not for m@@ y@@ self@@ , but I was af@@ ra@@ i@@ d that I was going to lo@@ se h@@ im@@ , that he was going to sin@@ k into one of his stat@@ es, and that I would ru@@ in his rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p with the vi@@ o@@ li@@ n if I started tal@@ king about sc@@ al@@ es and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ o@@ s and other ex@@ c@@ it@@ ing form@@ s of di@@ d@@ ac@@ ti@@ c vi@@ o@@ li@@ n pe@@ d@@ ag@@ og@@ y.
So, I just started pla@@ y@@ ing.
And I pla@@ y@@ ed the first mo@@ v@@ em@@ ent of the Be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven V@@ i@@ o@@ li@@ n C@@ on@@ cer@@ to@@ .
And as I pla@@ y@@ ed, I under@@ st@@ oo@@ d that there was a pro@@ found change oc@@ c@@ ur@@ r@@ ing in N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ iel@@ 's ey@@ es.
It was as if he was in the g@@ ri@@ p of some inv@@ is@@ i@@ ble ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ eu@@ tic@@ al, a ch@@ em@@ ical re@@ ac@@ tion, for which my pla@@ ying the mus@@ ic was its c@@ at@@ al@@ y@@ st.
And N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ iel@@ 's man@@ ic r@@ age was trans@@ form@@ ed into under@@ stand@@ ing, a qu@@ ie@@ t c@@ u@@ ri@@ o@@ s@@ ity and gr@@ ac@@ e.
And in a m@@ ir@@ ac@@ l@@ e, he lif@@ ted his own vi@@ o@@ li@@ n and he started pla@@ y@@ ing, by ear@@ , cer@@ ta@@ in s@@ ni@@ pp@@ et@@ s of vi@@ o@@ li@@ n con@@ cer@@ to@@ s which he then as@@ ked me to compl@@ ete -- M@@ end@@ el@@ s@@ so@@ h@@ n, T@@ ch@@ a@@ ik@@ o@@ v@@ sk@@ y, Si@@ bel@@ i@@ us@@ .
And we started tal@@ king about mus@@ ic@@ , from B@@ ach to Be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven and B@@ ra@@ h@@ m@@ s, B@@ ru@@ ck@@ n@@ er, all the B@@ '@@ s, from B@@ ar@@ t@@ ó@@ k, all the way up to E@@ sa@@ -@@ P@@ ek@@ k@@ a S@@ al@@ on@@ en.
And I under@@ st@@ oo@@ d that he not only had an enc@@ y@@ c@@ lo@@ pe@@ di@@ c kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge of mus@@ ic@@ , but he rel@@ ated to this mus@@ ic at a per@@ son@@ al le@@ vel@@ .
He sp@@ o@@ ke about it with the kind of passi@@ on and under@@ stand@@ ing that I sh@@ are with my col@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es in the L@@ o@@ s An@@ gel@@ es Ph@@ il@@ har@@ mon@@ ic@@ .
And through pla@@ ying mus@@ ic and tal@@ king about mus@@ ic@@ , this man had trans@@ form@@ ed from the par@@ an@@ o@@ i@@ d, di@@ st@@ ur@@ b@@ ed man that had just come from wal@@ king the st@@ re@@ et@@ s of do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn L@@ o@@ s An@@ gel@@ es to the ch@@ ar@@ m@@ ing, er@@ u@@ d@@ it@@ e, bri@@ lli@@ an@@ t, J@@ u@@ illi@@ ar@@ d@@ -@@ tra@@ in@@ ed mus@@ ic@@ i@@ an.
Mus@@ ic is me@@ dic@@ in@@ e. Mus@@ ic chang@@ es us@@ .
And for N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ iel@@ , mus@@ ic is s@@ an@@ ity.
Because mus@@ ic all@@ o@@ ws hi@@ m to take his thou@@ gh@@ ts and del@@ us@@ i@@ ons and s@@ ha@@ pe them through his imag@@ in@@ ation and his cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity, into real@@ ity.
And that is an es@@ cap@@ e from his tor@@ ment@@ ed stat@@ e.
And I under@@ st@@ oo@@ d that this was the very ess@@ ence of ar@@ t.
This was the very reas@@ on why we made mus@@ ic@@ , that we take something that ex@@ ist@@ s with@@ in all of us at our very f@@ und@@ am@@ ent@@ al cor@@ e, our em@@ o@@ tion@@ s, and through our ar@@ ti@@ st@@ ic l@@ en@@ s, through our cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity, we're able to s@@ ha@@ pe those em@@ o@@ tions into real@@ ity.
And the real@@ ity of that ex@@ pres@@ sion re@@ ach@@ es all of us and mo@@ ves us@@ , in@@ sp@@ ir@@ es and un@@ it@@ es us@@ .
And for N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ iel@@ , mus@@ ic br@@ ou@@ ght hi@@ m back into a fol@@ d of fri@@ end@@ s.
The re@@ de@@ m@@ p@@ tive po@@ wer of mus@@ ic br@@ ou@@ ght hi@@ m back into a fam@@ il@@ y of mus@@ ic@@ i@@ ans that under@@ st@@ oo@@ d h@@ im@@ , that re@@ co@@ g@@ n@@ iz@@ ed his tal@@ ents and res@@ p@@ ec@@ ted h@@ im@@ .
And I will al@@ ways make mus@@ ic with N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ iel@@ , wh@@ e@@ ther we're at W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y C@@ on@@ c@@ ert H@@ all or on S@@ ki@@ d Ro@@ w, because he re@@ min@@ ds me why I bec@@ ame a mus@@ ic@@ i@@ an.
Thank you.
B@@ r@@ un@@ o G@@ i@@ us@@ s@@ an@@ i@@ : Thank you. Th@@ ank@@ s.
Ro@@ ber@@ t G@@ up@@ ta@@ .
Ro@@ ber@@ t G@@ up@@ ta@@ : I'm going to pla@@ y something that I sh@@ am@@ el@@ ess@@ ly st@@ ole from c@@ el@@ li@@ st@@ s.
So, pl@@ eas@@ e for@@ give m@@ e.
I'm J@@ an@@ e M@@ c@@ G@@ on@@ ig@@ al. I'm a g@@ ame design@@ er.
I've been ma@@ king g@@ am@@ es on@@ l@@ ine now for 10 year@@ s, and my go@@ al for the next de@@ c@@ ade is to try to make it as eas@@ y to sa@@ ve the world in real life as it is to sa@@ ve the world in on@@ l@@ ine g@@ am@@ es.
Now, I have a pl@@ an for this, and it ent@@ a@@ il@@ s con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ing more peopl@@ e, in@@ c@@ lu@@ ding all of you@@ , to sp@@ end more time pla@@ ying b@@ ig@@ ger and bet@@ ter g@@ am@@ es.
R@@ ight now we sp@@ end three b@@ illion h@@ our@@ s a we@@ e@@ k pla@@ ying on@@ l@@ ine g@@ am@@ es.
S@@ ome of you might be thin@@ k@@ ing, "@@ That's a lot of time to sp@@ end pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es.
Ma@@ y@@ be to@@ o much time, con@@ si@@ der@@ ing how many ur@@ gen@@ t problem@@ s we have to sol@@ ve in the real worl@@ d@@ ."
But actu@@ ally, acc@@ ord@@ ing to my res@@ ear@@ ch at the In@@ st@@ itu@@ te for the F@@ ut@@ u@@ re, actually the op@@ pos@@ ite is tru@@ e.
Th@@ re@@ e b@@ illion h@@ our@@ s a we@@ e@@ k is not ne@@ ar@@ ly en@@ ough g@@ ame pla@@ y to sol@@ ve the worl@@ d@@ 's most ur@@ gen@@ t problem@@ s.
In fac@@ t, I belie@@ ve that if we want to sur@@ vi@@ ve the next cent@@ ur@@ y on this plan@@ et, we need to incre@@ ase that to@@ t@@ al dr@@ am@@ ati@@ call@@ y.
I've c@@ al@@ cul@@ ated the to@@ t@@ al we need at 2@@ 1 b@@ illion h@@ our@@ s of g@@ ame pla@@ y every we@@ ek@@ .
So, that's pro@@ bab@@ ly a bit of a co@@ unter@@ -@@ in@@ tu@@ iti@@ ve ide@@ a, so I'@@ ll say it again@@ , le@@ t it sin@@ k in@@ : If we want to sol@@ ve problem@@ s like h@@ ung@@ er, po@@ ver@@ t@@ y, c@@ lim@@ ate chang@@ e, glob@@ al con@@ f@@ lic@@ t, o@@ bes@@ ity, I belie@@ ve that we need to as@@ p@@ ir@@ e to pla@@ y g@@ am@@ es on@@ l@@ ine for at le@@ ast 2@@ 1 b@@ illion h@@ our@@ s a we@@ ek@@ , by the end of the next de@@ c@@ ad@@ e.
No@@ . I'm ser@@ i@@ ou@@ s. I am@@ .
Her@@ e's wh@@ y.
This pic@@ ture pre@@ tt@@ y much sum@@ s up why I think g@@ am@@ es are so ess@@ enti@@ al to the f@@ ut@@ ure sur@@ vi@@ v@@ al of the human spec@@ i@@ es. T@@ r@@ ul@@ y.
This is a p@@ ort@@ ra@@ it by p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ er P@@ hi@@ l T@@ ol@@ ed@@ an@@ o.
He wanted to cap@@ ture the em@@ o@@ tion of g@@ am@@ ing, so he se@@ t up a c@@ amer@@ a in fr@@ on@@ t of g@@ am@@ ers wh@@ ile they were pla@@ y@@ ing.
And this is a c@@ las@@ si@@ c g@@ am@@ ing em@@ o@@ tion.
Now, if you're not a g@@ am@@ er, you might mis@@ s some of the nu@@ ance in this p@@ ho@@ to@@ .
You pro@@ bab@@ ly see the sen@@ se of ur@@ gen@@ c@@ y, a little bit of f@@ ear@@ , but in@@ ten@@ se con@@ cent@@ r@@ ation, de@@ ep@@ , de@@ ep f@@ oc@@ us on t@@ ac@@ kl@@ ing a really di@@ ff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t problem@@ .
If you are a g@@ am@@ er, you will no@@ ti@@ ce a few nu@@ anc@@ es her@@ e: the c@@ r@@ in@@ k@@ le of the ey@@ es up@@ , and around the m@@ ou@@ th is a s@@ ign of op@@ tim@@ is@@ m, and the ey@@ eb@@ ro@@ ws up is sur@@ pr@@ is@@ e.
This is a g@@ am@@ er wh@@ o@@ 's on the ver@@ ge of something called an "@@ ep@@ ic win@@ ."
O@@ h, you@@ 've hear@@ d of that.
OK@@ , go@@ o@@ d, so we have some g@@ am@@ ers am@@ ong us@@ .
A@@ n ep@@ ic w@@ in is an ou@@ t@@ come that is so ex@@ tra@@ ord@@ in@@ ar@@ il@@ y pos@@ iti@@ ve, you had no idea it was even possi@@ ble un@@ ti@@ l you ach@@ ie@@ ved it.
It was al@@ most be@@ y@@ on@@ d the th@@ res@@ h@@ old of imag@@ in@@ ation, and when you get ther@@ e, you're sho@@ ck@@ ed to dis@@ co@@ ver what you're tr@@ ul@@ y cap@@ able of@@ .
That's an ep@@ ic win@@ .
This is a g@@ am@@ er on the ver@@ ge of an ep@@ ic win@@ .
And this is the fac@@ e that we need to see on m@@ illi@@ ons of problem@@ -@@ sol@@ ver@@ s all over the world as we try to t@@ ack@@ le the ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les of the next cent@@ ur@@ y -- the fac@@ e of some@@ one wh@@ o, again@@ st all o@@ d@@ d@@ s, is on the ver@@ ge of an ep@@ ic win@@ .
Now, un@@ for@@ tun@@ at@@ ely this is more of the fac@@ e that we see in every@@ day life now as we try to t@@ ack@@ le ur@@ gen@@ t problem@@ s.
This is what I c@@ all the "@@ I'm No@@ t G@@ oo@@ d A@@ t Li@@ fe@@ " fac@@ e.
This is actually me ma@@ king it. C@@ an you se@@ e? Y@@ es. G@@ oo@@ d.
This is me ma@@ king the "@@ I'm No@@ t G@@ oo@@ d A@@ t Li@@ fe@@ " fac@@ e.
This is a pi@@ ec@@ e of gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i in my old n@@ ei@@ gh@@ b@@ or@@ ho@@ od in B@@ er@@ k@@ el@@ e@@ y, C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a, where I did my Ph@@ D on why we're bet@@ ter in g@@ am@@ es than we are in real lif@@ e.
And this is a pro@@ blem that a lot of g@@ am@@ ers ha@@ ve.
We fe@@ el that we are not as good in real@@ ity as we are in g@@ am@@ es.
I don't me@@ an just good as in su@@ c@@ c@@ ess@@ ful@@ , al@@ th@@ ough that's part of it.
We do ach@@ ie@@ ve more in g@@ ame worl@@ d@@ s.
But I also me@@ an good as in mo@@ tiv@@ ated to do something that mat@@ ter@@ s -- in@@ sp@@ i@@ red to c@@ oll@@ ab@@ or@@ ate and to co@@ o@@ per@@ at@@ e.
And when we're in g@@ ame worl@@ d@@ s, I belie@@ ve that many of us be@@ come the bes@@ t ver@@ sion of our@@ sel@@ ves -- the most lik@@ ely to hel@@ p at a m@@ om@@ ent@@ 's no@@ tic@@ e, the most lik@@ ely to st@@ ic@@ k with a pro@@ blem as long at it ta@@ k@@ es, to get up after fa@@ il@@ ure and try again@@ .
And in real lif@@ e, when we fac@@ e fa@@ il@@ u@@ re, when we con@@ fr@@ on@@ t ob@@ st@@ ac@@ l@@ es, we of@@ ten don't fe@@ el that wa@@ y.
We fe@@ el o@@ ver@@ com@@ e, we fe@@ el o@@ ver@@ wh@@ el@@ me@@ d, we fe@@ el an@@ x@@ i@@ ou@@ s, ma@@ y@@ be de@@ pres@@ se@@ d, f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated or c@@ y@@ n@@ ic@@ al.
We never have those fe@@ el@@ ing@@ s when we're pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es, they just don't ex@@ ist in g@@ am@@ es.
So that's what I wanted to stu@@ dy when I was a gra@@ du@@ ate stu@@ den@@ t.
What about g@@ am@@ es ma@@ kes it im@@ possi@@ ble to fe@@ el that we can't ach@@ ie@@ ve every@@ thing@@ ?
How can we take those fe@@ el@@ ing@@ s from g@@ am@@ es and ap@@ pl@@ y them to real@@ -@@ world wor@@ k@@ ?
So I loo@@ ked at g@@ am@@ es like Wor@@ ld of War@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t, which is really the ide@@ al c@@ oll@@ ab@@ or@@ ative problem@@ -@@ sol@@ ving en@@ vir@@ on@@ men@@ t.
And I started to no@@ ti@@ ce a few things that make ep@@ ic win@@ s so possi@@ ble in on@@ l@@ ine worl@@ d@@ s.
The first thing is wh@@ en@@ ever you show up in one of these on@@ l@@ ine g@@ am@@ es, es@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ ally in Wor@@ ld of War@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t, there are lo@@ ts and lo@@ ts of different ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ s who are wi@@ ll@@ ing to tr@@ ust you with a worl@@ d@@ -@@ sa@@ ving mis@@ si@@ on, right a@@ wa@@ y.
But not just any mis@@ si@@ on, it's a mis@@ sion that is per@@ f@@ ec@@ t@@ ly mat@@ ch@@ ed with your c@@ ur@@ r@@ ent le@@ v@@ el in the g@@ am@@ e.
R@@ igh@@ t? So you can do it.
They never give you a ch@@ all@@ enge you can't ach@@ ie@@ ve.
But it is on the ver@@ ge of what you're cap@@ able of@@ , so you have to try har@@ d.
But there's no un@@ em@@ pl@@ o@@ y@@ ment in Wor@@ ld of War@@ c@@ ra@@ ft@@ ; no sit@@ ting ar@@ oun@@ d, w@@ r@@ ing@@ ing your h@@ and@@ s -- there's al@@ ways something spec@@ if@@ ic and import@@ ant to be don@@ e.
There are also t@@ ons of c@@ oll@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ s.
E@@ ver@@ y@@ where you go@@ , h@@ und@@ re@@ ds of thou@@ s@@ and@@ s of people read@@ y to work with you to ach@@ ie@@ ve your ep@@ ic mis@@ si@@ on.
That's not something we have in real life that eas@@ il@@ y, this sen@@ se that at our f@@ ing@@ er@@ ti@@ ps are t@@ ons of c@@ oll@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ s.
And there's this ep@@ ic stor@@ y, this in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing stor@@ y of why we're ther@@ e, and what we're do@@ ing, and we get all this pos@@ iti@@ ve fe@@ ed@@ bac@@ k.
You gu@@ ys have hear@@ d of le@@ vel@@ ing up@@ , +@@ 1 str@@ eng@@ th@@ , +@@ 1 in@@ tel@@ li@@ gen@@ c@@ e.
We don't get that kind of con@@ st@@ ant fe@@ ed@@ back in real lif@@ e.
When I get off this st@@ ag@@ e, I'm not going to have +@@ 1 spe@@ ak@@ ing, and +@@ 1 c@@ ra@@ z@@ y ide@@ a, +@@ 20 c@@ ra@@ z@@ y ide@@ a.
I don't get that fe@@ ed@@ back in real lif@@ e.
Now, the pro@@ blem with c@@ oll@@ ab@@ or@@ ative on@@ l@@ ine en@@ vir@@ on@@ m@@ ents like Wor@@ ld of War@@ c@@ ra@@ ft is that it's so s@@ at@@ is@@ f@@ ying to be on the ver@@ ge of an ep@@ ic w@@ in all the time, we de@@ ci@@ de to sp@@ end all our time in these g@@ ame worl@@ d@@ s.
It's just bet@@ ter than real@@ ity.
So, so f@@ ar@@ , col@@ le@@ c@@ tiv@@ ely all the Wor@@ ld of War@@ c@@ ra@@ ft g@@ am@@ ers have sp@@ ent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years sol@@ ving the vir@@ tu@@ al problem@@ s of A@@ z@@ er@@ o@@ th@@ .
Now, that's not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ il@@ y a b@@ ad thing@@ .
It might so@@ und like it's a b@@ ad thing@@ .
But to put that in con@@ t@@ ex@@ t: 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ag@@ o was when our ear@@ li@@ est pri@@ m@@ ate human anc@@ est@@ or@@ s st@@ oo@@ d up@@ .
That was the first up@@ right pri@@ mat@@ e.
So when we talk about how much time we're c@@ ur@@ r@@ ent@@ ly inv@@ es@@ ting in pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es, the only way it ma@@ kes sen@@ se to even think about it is to talk about time at the mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de of human evol@@ u@@ tion, which is an ex@@ tra@@ ord@@ in@@ ary thing@@ .
But it's also ap@@ t, because it tur@@ n@@ s out that by sp@@ end@@ ing all this time pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es, we're actually chang@@ ing what we are cap@@ able of as human bein@@ g@@ s.
We@@ 're evol@@ ving to be a more c@@ oll@@ ab@@ or@@ ative and hear@@ ty spec@@ i@@ es.
This is tru@@ e. I belie@@ ve this.
So, con@@ si@@ der this really interes@@ ting st@@ ati@@ st@@ ic@@ ; it was rec@@ ent@@ ly p@@ ub@@ li@@ sh@@ ed by a res@@ ear@@ ch@@ er at C@@ ar@@ ne@@ g@@ ie M@@ ell@@ on Univers@@ it@@ y@@ : The a@@ ver@@ age y@@ o@@ ung per@@ son to@@ day in a coun@@ try with a str@@ ong g@@ am@@ er cul@@ ture will have sp@@ ent 1@@ 0@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s pla@@ ying on@@ l@@ ine g@@ am@@ es by the age of 2@@ 1@@ .
Now 1@@ 0@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s is a really interes@@ ting num@@ ber for two reas@@ on@@ s.
F@@ ir@@ st of all@@ , for childr@@ en in the Un@@ ited St@@ at@@ es, 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 8@@ 0 h@@ our@@ s is the ex@@ ac@@ t am@@ oun@@ t of time you will sp@@ end in sch@@ o@@ ol@@ , from fi@@ f@@ th gra@@ de to h@@ ig@@ h sch@@ oo@@ l gra@@ du@@ ation, if you have per@@ f@@ ect at@@ ten@@ d@@ anc@@ e.
So, we have an enti@@ re par@@ all@@ el tr@@ ack of e@@ duc@@ ation going on, where y@@ o@@ ung people are lear@@ ning as much about what it ta@@ kes to be a good g@@ am@@ er as they're lear@@ ning about every@@ thing el@@ se in sch@@ o@@ ol@@ .
S@@ ome of you have pro@@ bab@@ ly re@@ ad M@@ al@@ col@@ m G@@ l@@ ad@@ w@@ ell@@ 's new bo@@ ok "@@ O@@ ut@@ li@@ er@@ s@@ ," so you would have hear@@ d of his the@@ or@@ y of su@@ c@@ c@@ es@@ s, the "@@ 1@@ 0@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s@@ " the@@ or@@ y of su@@ c@@ c@@ es@@ s.
It's bas@@ ed on this great co@@ g@@ n@@ iti@@ v@@ e-@@ sci@@ ence res@@ ear@@ ch that sa@@ ys if we can ma@@ ster 1@@ 0@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s of eff@@ ort@@ ful stu@@ dy at any@@ thing by the age of 2@@ 1@@ , we will be vir@@ tu@@ o@@ so@@ s at it.
We will be as good at wh@@ at@@ ever we do as the gre@@ at@@ est people in the world.
And so, now what we're looking at is an enti@@ re gener@@ ation of y@@ o@@ ung people who are vir@@ tu@@ o@@ so g@@ amer@@ s.
So, the big ques@@ tion is, "@@ What ex@@ ac@@ t@@ ly are g@@ am@@ ers get@@ ting so good at@@ ?"
Because if we could f@@ ig@@ ure that ou@@ t, we would have a vir@@ tu@@ ally un@@ pre@@ c@@ ed@@ ent@@ ed human res@@ our@@ ce on our h@@ and@@ s.
This is how many people we now have in the world who sp@@ end at le@@ ast an h@@ our a day pla@@ ying on@@ l@@ ine g@@ am@@ es.
Th@@ ese are our vir@@ tu@@ o@@ so g@@ amer@@ s, 5@@ 00 million people who are ex@@ tra@@ ord@@ in@@ ar@@ il@@ y good at some@@ thing@@ .
And in the next de@@ c@@ ad@@ e, we're going to have another b@@ illion g@@ am@@ ers who are ex@@ tra@@ ord@@ in@@ ar@@ il@@ y good at wh@@ at@@ ever that is.
If you don't know it al@@ read@@ y, this is com@@ ing.
The g@@ ame in@@ du@@ str@@ y is devel@@ op@@ ing con@@ sol@@ es that are lo@@ w@@ -@@ energ@@ y and that work with the wir@@ el@@ ess ph@@ one net@@ wor@@ ks in@@ ste@@ ad of b@@ ro@@ ad@@ b@@ and Inter@@ n@@ et, so that g@@ am@@ ers all over the worl@@ d, par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly in Indi@@ a, Chin@@ a, B@@ ra@@ z@@ il@@ , can get on@@ lin@@ e.
They exp@@ ect one b@@ illion more g@@ am@@ ers in the next de@@ c@@ ad@@ e.
It will br@@ ing us up to 1@@ .@@ 5 b@@ illion g@@ amer@@ s.
So I've started to think about what these g@@ am@@ es are ma@@ king us vir@@ tu@@ o@@ so@@ s at@@ .
H@@ ere are the f@@ our things I came up with@@ . The first is ur@@ gen@@ t op@@ tim@@ is@@ m.
OK@@ , think of this as ex@@ tre@@ me self@@ -@@ mo@@ tiv@@ ation.
U@@ r@@ gen@@ t op@@ tim@@ is@@ m is the des@@ ir@@ e to ac@@ t im@@ me@@ di@@ at@@ ely to t@@ ack@@ le an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ l@@ e, com@@ bin@@ ed with the belie@@ f that we have a reas@@ on@@ able ho@@ pe of su@@ c@@ c@@ es@@ s.
G@@ am@@ ers al@@ ways belie@@ ve that an ep@@ ic w@@ in is possi@@ bl@@ e, and that it's al@@ ways wor@@ th tr@@ y@@ ing, and tr@@ ying no@@ w.
G@@ am@@ ers don't s@@ it ar@@ oun@@ d.
G@@ am@@ ers are vir@@ tu@@ o@@ so@@ s at we@@ a@@ ving a ti@@ ght soci@@ al f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c@@ .
Ther@@ e's a lot of interes@@ ting res@@ ear@@ ch that sho@@ ws we like people bet@@ ter after we pla@@ y a g@@ ame with them@@ , even if they@@ 've be@@ at@@ en us b@@ ad@@ l@@ y.
And the reas@@ on is, it ta@@ kes a lot of tr@@ ust to pla@@ y a g@@ ame with some@@ on@@ e.
We tr@@ ust that they will sp@@ end their time with us@@ , that they will pla@@ y by the same r@@ ul@@ es, v@@ al@@ u@@ e the same go@@ al, st@@ a@@ y with the g@@ ame un@@ ti@@ l it's o@@ ver@@ .
And so, pla@@ ying a g@@ ame toge@@ ther actually bu@@ il@@ ds up b@@ on@@ ds and tr@@ ust and co@@ o@@ per@@ ation.
And we actually bu@@ ild str@@ on@@ ger soci@@ al rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ ps as a res@@ ul@@ t.
B@@ li@@ s@@ s@@ ful produc@@ tiv@@ ity. I lo@@ ve it.
You know, there's a reas@@ on why the a@@ ver@@ age Wor@@ ld of War@@ c@@ ra@@ ft g@@ am@@ er pla@@ ys for 2@@ 2 h@@ our@@ s a we@@ e@@ k -- kind of a hal@@ f@@ -@@ time j@@ ob@@ .
It's because we know, when we're pla@@ ying a g@@ am@@ e, that we're actually happ@@ ier wor@@ king har@@ d than we are rel@@ a@@ x@@ ing, or h@@ ang@@ ing ou@@ t.
We know that we are op@@ tim@@ iz@@ ed as human bein@@ g@@ s, to do har@@ d and me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful wor@@ k.
And g@@ am@@ ers are wi@@ ll@@ ing to work har@@ d all the time, if they're gi@@ ven the right wor@@ k.
F@@ in@@ all@@ y@@ : ep@@ ic me@@ an@@ ing.
G@@ am@@ ers lo@@ ve to be at@@ t@@ ach@@ ed to a@@ we@@ -@@ in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing mis@@ si@@ ons to human plan@@ et@@ ar@@ y@@ -@@ sc@@ ale stor@@ i@@ es.
So, just one bit of tri@@ vi@@ a that hel@@ ps put that into per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ e: So, you all know W@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ di@@ a, b@@ ig@@ ges@@ t wi@@ k@@ i in the world.
S@@ econ@@ d b@@ ig@@ ges@@ t wi@@ k@@ i in the worl@@ d, with ne@@ ar@@ ly 8@@ 0@@ ,000 ar@@ tic@@ l@@ es, is the Wor@@ ld of War@@ c@@ ra@@ ft wi@@ ki@@ .
F@@ i@@ ve million people use it every mon@@ th@@ .
They have comp@@ il@@ ed more in@@ form@@ ation about Wor@@ ld of War@@ c@@ ra@@ ft on the Inter@@ net than any other to@@ p@@ ic co@@ ver@@ ed on any other wi@@ k@@ i in the world.
They are build@@ ing an ep@@ ic stor@@ y.
They are build@@ ing an ep@@ ic kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge res@@ our@@ ce about the Wor@@ ld of War@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t.
O@@ ka@@ y, so these are f@@ our su@@ per@@ po@@ wer@@ s that ad@@ d up to one thing@@ : G@@ am@@ ers are su@@ per@@ -@@ em@@ po@@ wer@@ ed ho@@ pe@@ ful in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al@@ s.
Th@@ ese are people who belie@@ ve that they are in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ ally cap@@ able of chang@@ ing the world.
And the only pro@@ blem is, they belie@@ ve that they are cap@@ able of chang@@ ing vir@@ tu@@ al worl@@ ds and not the real world.
That's the pro@@ blem that I'm tr@@ ying to sol@@ ve.
Ther@@ e's an econ@@ om@@ ist nam@@ ed E@@ d@@ war@@ d C@@ a@@ str@@ on@@ o@@ v@@ a.
H@@ is work is bri@@ lli@@ an@@ t.
He loo@@ ks at why people are inv@@ es@@ ting so much time and energ@@ y and mon@@ ey in on@@ l@@ ine worl@@ d@@ s.
And he sa@@ y@@ s, "@@ We@@ 're wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ing what am@@ oun@@ ts to no l@@ ess than a m@@ as@@ s ex@@ o@@ du@@ s to vir@@ tu@@ al worl@@ ds and on@@ l@@ ine g@@ ame en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment@@ s@@ ."
And h@@ e's an econ@@ om@@ ist, so h@@ e's r@@ ation@@ al.
And he sa@@ ys -- No@@ t like me, I'm a g@@ ame design@@ er@@ ; I'm ex@@ u@@ ber@@ an@@ t.
But he sa@@ ys that this ma@@ kes per@@ f@@ ect sen@@ se, because g@@ am@@ ers can ach@@ ie@@ ve more in on@@ l@@ ine worl@@ ds than they can in real lif@@ e.
They can have str@@ on@@ ger soci@@ al rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ ps in g@@ am@@ es than they can have in real li@@ fe@@ ; they get bet@@ ter fe@@ ed@@ back and fe@@ el more re@@ war@@ ded in g@@ am@@ es than they do in real lif@@ e.
So he sa@@ y@@ s, for now it ma@@ kes per@@ f@@ ect sen@@ se for g@@ am@@ ers to sp@@ end more time in vir@@ tu@@ al worl@@ ds than the real world.
Now, I also ag@@ re@@ e that that is r@@ ation@@ al, for no@@ w.
But it is no@@ t, by any me@@ an@@ s, an op@@ tim@@ al s@@ itu@@ ation.
We have to start ma@@ king the real world work more like a g@@ am@@ e.
I take my in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation from something that happen@@ ed 2@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 years ag@@ o.
Th@@ ese are an@@ ci@@ ent dic@@ e, made out of sh@@ e@@ ep@@ 's k@@ nu@@ ck@@ l@@ es.
Be@@ for@@ e we had a@@ w@@ es@@ ome g@@ ame con@@ tro@@ ll@@ er@@ s, we had sh@@ e@@ ep@@ 's k@@ nu@@ ck@@ l@@ es.
And these re@@ pres@@ ent the first g@@ ame e@@ qu@@ i@@ p@@ ment design@@ ed by human bein@@ g@@ s, and if you're fam@@ ili@@ ar with the work of the an@@ ci@@ ent G@@ re@@ e@@ k h@@ ist@@ ori@@ an Her@@ o@@ do@@ t@@ us@@ , you might know this h@@ ist@@ or@@ y, which is the h@@ ist@@ or@@ y of who inv@@ ent@@ ed g@@ am@@ es and wh@@ y.
Her@@ o@@ do@@ tu@@ s sa@@ ys that g@@ am@@ es, par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly di@@ ce g@@ am@@ es, were inv@@ ent@@ ed in the k@@ ing@@ do@@ m of L@@ y@@ di@@ a, dur@@ ing a time of fam@@ in@@ e.
A@@ pp@@ ar@@ ent@@ ly, there was su@@ ch a se@@ ver@@ e fam@@ ine that the king of L@@ y@@ di@@ a de@@ ci@@ ded they had to do something c@@ ra@@ z@@ y.
P@@ e@@ o@@ ple were su@@ ffer@@ ing. P@@ e@@ o@@ ple were f@@ igh@@ t@@ ing.
It was an ex@@ tre@@ me s@@ itu@@ ation, they ne@@ ed@@ ed an ex@@ tre@@ me sol@@ u@@ tion.
So, acc@@ ord@@ ing to Her@@ o@@ do@@ t@@ us@@ , they inv@@ ent@@ ed di@@ ce g@@ am@@ es, and they se@@ t up a k@@ ing@@ d@@ om@@ -@@ wi@@ de po@@ lic@@ y@@ : O@@ n one da@@ y, every@@ body would e@@ at@@ , and on the next da@@ y, every@@ body would pla@@ y g@@ am@@ es.
And they would be so im@@ mer@@ s@@ ed in pla@@ ying the di@@ ce g@@ am@@ es, because g@@ am@@ es are so eng@@ ag@@ ing, and im@@ mer@@ se us in su@@ ch s@@ at@@ is@@ f@@ y@@ ing, b@@ li@@ s@@ s@@ ful produc@@ tiv@@ ity, they would ign@@ or@@ e the fac@@ t that they had no foo@@ d to e@@ at@@ .
And then on the next da@@ y, they would pla@@ y g@@ am@@ es@@ ; and on the next da@@ y, they would e@@ at@@ .
And acc@@ ord@@ ing to Her@@ o@@ do@@ t@@ us@@ , they pas@@ s@@ ed 1@@ 8 years this way, sur@@ vi@@ ving through a fam@@ in@@ e, by e@@ ating on one da@@ y, and pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es on the nex@@ t.
Now, this is ex@@ ac@@ tl@@ y, I thin@@ k, how we're us@@ ing g@@ am@@ es to@@ da@@ y.
We@@ 're us@@ ing g@@ am@@ es to es@@ cap@@ e real@@ -@@ world su@@ ffer@@ ing -- we're us@@ ing g@@ am@@ es to get a@@ way from every@@ thing that's b@@ ro@@ ken in the real en@@ vir@@ on@@ men@@ t, every@@ thing that's not s@@ at@@ is@@ f@@ ying about real lif@@ e, and we're get@@ ting what we need from g@@ am@@ es.
But it doesn't have to end there.
This is really ex@@ c@@ it@@ ing.
A@@ c@@ c@@ ord@@ ing to Her@@ o@@ do@@ t@@ us@@ , after 1@@ 8 years the fam@@ ine was@@ n't get@@ ting bet@@ ter, so the king de@@ ci@@ ded they would pla@@ y one fin@@ al di@@ ce g@@ am@@ e.
They di@@ vi@@ ded the enti@@ re k@@ ing@@ do@@ m in hal@@ f@@ .
They pla@@ y@@ ed one di@@ ce g@@ am@@ e, and the w@@ inn@@ ers of that g@@ ame got to go on an ep@@ ic ad@@ v@@ ent@@ u@@ re.
They would le@@ a@@ ve L@@ y@@ di@@ a, and they would go out in se@@ ar@@ ch of a new plac@@ e to li@@ ve, le@@ a@@ ving beh@@ ind just en@@ ough people to sur@@ vi@@ ve on the res@@ our@@ c@@ es that were av@@ a@@ il@@ abl@@ e, and ho@@ pe@@ ful@@ ly to take their ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation some@@ where el@@ se where they could th@@ ri@@ ve.
Now, this so@@ und@@ s c@@ ra@@ z@@ y, righ@@ t?
But rec@@ ent@@ ly, D@@ N@@ A e@@ vi@@ den@@ ce has sho@@ wn that the E@@ tr@@ us@@ can@@ s, who then l@@ ed to the R@@ om@@ an E@@ m@@ pi@@ re, actually sh@@ are the same D@@ N@@ A as the an@@ ci@@ ent L@@ y@@ di@@ an@@ s.
And so, rec@@ ent@@ ly, sci@@ enti@@ st@@ s have su@@ g@@ ges@@ ted that Her@@ o@@ do@@ t@@ us@@ ' c@@ ra@@ z@@ y stor@@ y is actually tru@@ e.
And ge@@ olog@@ ist@@ s have found e@@ vi@@ den@@ ce of a glob@@ al co@@ ol@@ ing that la@@ st@@ ed for ne@@ ar@@ ly 20 year@@ s, that could have ex@@ pl@@ ain@@ ed the fam@@ in@@ e.
So this c@@ ra@@ z@@ y stor@@ y might be tru@@ e.
They might have actually sa@@ ved their cul@@ ture by pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es, es@@ cap@@ ing to g@@ am@@ es for 1@@ 8 year@@ s, and then been so in@@ sp@@ i@@ re@@ d, and k@@ new so much about how to come toge@@ ther with g@@ am@@ es, that they actually sa@@ ved the enti@@ re ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation that wa@@ y.
O@@ ka@@ y, we can do that.
We@@ 've been pla@@ ying War@@ c@@ ra@@ ft sin@@ ce 19@@ 9@@ 4@@ .
That was the first real@@ -@@ time str@@ at@@ eg@@ y g@@ ame from the Wor@@ ld of War@@ c@@ ra@@ ft ser@@ i@@ es.
That was 1@@ 6 years ag@@ o.
They pla@@ y@@ ed di@@ ce g@@ am@@ es for 1@@ 8 year@@ s, we've been pla@@ ying War@@ c@@ ra@@ ft for 1@@ 6 year@@ s.
I say we are read@@ y for our own ep@@ ic g@@ am@@ e.
Now, they had hal@@ f the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation go off in se@@ ar@@ ch of a new worl@@ d, so that's where I get my 2@@ 1 b@@ illion h@@ our@@ s a we@@ e@@ k of g@@ am@@ e-@@ pla@@ y fro@@ m.
L@@ et's get hal@@ f of us to ag@@ re@@ e to sp@@ end an h@@ our a day pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es, un@@ ti@@ l we sol@@ ve real@@ -@@ world problem@@ s.
Now, I know you're as@@ k@@ ing, "@@ How are we going to sol@@ ve real@@ -@@ world problem@@ s in g@@ am@@ es@@ ?"
Well, that's what I've de@@ v@@ o@@ ted my work to over the pas@@ t few year@@ s, at the In@@ st@@ itu@@ te for the F@@ ut@@ u@@ re.
We have this b@@ ann@@ er in our off@@ ic@@ es in P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to@@ , and it ex@@ pres@@ s@@ es our vie@@ w of how we should try to rel@@ ate to the f@@ ut@@ u@@ re.
We do not want to try to pre@@ dic@@ t the f@@ ut@@ u@@ re.
What we want to do is make the f@@ ut@@ u@@ re.
We want to imag@@ ine the bes@@ t@@ -@@ c@@ ase sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o ou@@ t@@ com@@ e, and then we want to em@@ po@@ wer people to make that ou@@ t@@ come a real@@ ity.
We want to imag@@ ine ep@@ ic win@@ s, and then give people the me@@ ans to ach@@ ie@@ ve the ep@@ ic win@@ .
I'm just going to very bri@@ ef@@ ly show you three g@@ am@@ es that I've made that are an at@@ tem@@ p@@ t to give people the me@@ ans to cre@@ ate ep@@ ic win@@ s in their own f@@ ut@@ ur@@ es.
This is Wor@@ ld W@@ i@@ th@@ out O@@ il@@ .
We made this g@@ ame in 200@@ 7@@ .
This is an on@@ l@@ ine g@@ ame in which you try to sur@@ vi@@ ve an o@@ il sh@@ ort@@ ag@@ e.
The o@@ il sh@@ ort@@ age is f@@ ic@@ tion@@ al, but we put en@@ ough on@@ l@@ ine con@@ t@@ ent out there for you to belie@@ ve that it's re@@ al, and to li@@ ve your real life as if we've ru@@ n out of o@@ il@@ . So when you come to the g@@ am@@ e, you s@@ ign up@@ , tell us where you li@@ ve, and then we give you real@@ -@@ time ne@@ ws vi@@ de@@ o@@ s, dat@@ a fe@@ e@@ ds that show you ex@@ ac@@ t@@ ly how much o@@ il co@@ st@@ s, wh@@ at's not av@@ a@@ il@@ abl@@ e, how foo@@ d su@@ p@@ pl@@ y is being aff@@ ec@@ te@@ d,
how tr@@ an@@ sp@@ ort@@ ation is being aff@@ ec@@ te@@ d, if sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s are c@@ lo@@ se@@ d, if there's ri@@ o@@ t@@ ing, and you have to f@@ ig@@ ure out how you would li@@ ve your real life as if this were tru@@ e. And then we as@@ k you to b@@ lo@@ g about it, to po@@ st vi@@ de@@ o@@ s, to po@@ st p@@ ho@@ to@@ s.
We p@@ il@@ o@@ ted this g@@ ame with 1@@ ,@@ 7@@ 00 pla@@ y@@ ers in 200@@ 7@@ , and we've tr@@ ac@@ ked them for the three years sin@@ c@@ e.
And I can tell you that this is a trans@@ form@@ ative exper@@ i@@ enc@@ e.
No@@ body wan@@ ts to change how they li@@ ve, just because it's good for the worl@@ d, or because we're su@@ p@@ pos@@ ed to@@ .
But if you im@@ mer@@ se them in an ep@@ ic ad@@ v@@ ent@@ ure and tell them@@ , "@@ We@@ 've ru@@ n out of o@@ il@@ .
This is an am@@ az@@ ing stor@@ y and ad@@ v@@ ent@@ ure for you to go on.
Ch@@ all@@ enge you@@ r@@ sel@@ f to see how you would sur@@ vi@@ v@@ e@@ ," most of our pla@@ y@@ ers have k@@ ep@@ t up the hab@@ its that they lear@@ n@@ ed in this g@@ am@@ e.
So for the next worl@@ d@@ -@@ sa@@ ving g@@ am@@ e, we de@@ ci@@ ded to a@@ im h@@ igh@@ er -- b@@ ig@@ ger pro@@ blem than just pe@@ a@@ k o@@ il@@ .
We did a g@@ ame called Su@@ per@@ stru@@ c@@ t at the In@@ st@@ itu@@ te for the F@@ ut@@ u@@ re.
And the pre@@ mis@@ e was, a su@@ per@@ comp@@ uter has c@@ al@@ cul@@ ated that hum@@ ans have only 2@@ 3 years le@@ ft on the plan@@ et.
This su@@ per@@ comp@@ uter was called the G@@ lob@@ al Ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion A@@ war@@ en@@ ess Sy@@ st@@ em@@ , of cour@@ se.
We as@@ ked people to come on@@ l@@ ine -- al@@ most like a J@@ err@@ y B@@ ru@@ ck@@ hei@@ m@@ er mo@@ vi@@ e.
You know J@@ err@@ y B@@ ru@@ ck@@ hei@@ m@@ er mo@@ vi@@ es, you for@@ m a dre@@ am te@@ am -- you@@ 've got the a@@ str@@ on@@ au@@ t, the sci@@ enti@@ st, the ex@@ -@@ con@@ vi@@ c@@ t, and they all have something to do to sa@@ ve the world.
But in our g@@ am@@ e, in@@ ste@@ ad of just ha@@ ving fi@@ ve people on the dre@@ am te@@ am@@ , we said, "@@ E@@ ver@@ y@@ bo@@ d@@ y@@ 's on the dre@@ am te@@ am@@ , and it's your j@@ ob to inv@@ ent the f@@ ut@@ ure of energ@@ y, the f@@ ut@@ ure of foo@@ d, the f@@ ut@@ ure of he@@ al@@ th@@ , the f@@ ut@@ ure of s@@ ec@@ ur@@ ity and the f@@ ut@@ ure of the soci@@ al sa@@ f@@ et@@ y net@@ ."
We had 8@@ ,000 people pla@@ y that g@@ ame for ei@@ ght we@@ ek@@ s.
They came up with 5@@ 00 in@@ s@@ an@@ ely cre@@ ative sol@@ u@@ tions that you can go on@@ lin@@ e, Go@@ og@@ le "@@ Su@@ per@@ stru@@ c@@ t@@ ," and se@@ e.
So, fin@@ ally, the last g@@ am@@ e, we're la@@ un@@ ch@@ ing it Mar@@ ch 3@@ r@@ d. This is a g@@ ame d@@ one with the Wor@@ ld B@@ ank In@@ st@@ it@@ ut@@ e.
If you compl@@ ete the g@@ am@@ e, you will be cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ed by the Wor@@ ld B@@ ank In@@ st@@ itu@@ te as a S@@ o@@ ci@@ al In@@ no@@ v@@ at@@ or@@ , c@@ las@@ s of 20@@ 1@@ 0@@ .
Wor@@ king with un@@ ivers@@ iti@@ es all over sub@@ -@@ S@@ ah@@ ar@@ an Afric@@ a, and we are inv@@ it@@ ing them to lear@@ n soci@@ al in@@ no@@ v@@ ation sk@@ ill@@ s.
We@@ 've got a gra@@ p@@ hi@@ c no@@ vel@@ , we've got le@@ vel@@ ing up in sk@@ ill@@ s like lo@@ c@@ al in@@ s@@ igh@@ t, kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge net@@ wor@@ k@@ ing, su@@ st@@ ain@@ ab@@ ili@@ t@@ y, vis@@ ion and res@@ our@@ c@@ ef@@ ul@@ n@@ es@@ s.
I would like to inv@@ ite all of you to pl@@ eas@@ e sh@@ are this g@@ ame with y@@ o@@ ung peopl@@ e, any@@ where in the worl@@ d, par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly in devel@@ op@@ ing ar@@ eas@@ , who might ben@@ ef@@ it from com@@ ing toge@@ ther to try to start to imag@@ ine their own soci@@ al en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es to sa@@ ve the world.
So, I'm going to w@@ ra@@ p up no@@ w.
I want to as@@ k a ques@@ tion.
What do you think happ@@ ens nex@@ t?
We@@ 've got all these am@@ az@@ ing g@@ amer@@ s, we've got these g@@ am@@ es that are kind of p@@ il@@ o@@ ts of what we might do@@ , but n@@ one of them have sa@@ ved the real world y@@ et.
Wel@@ l I ho@@ pe you will ag@@ re@@ e with me that g@@ am@@ ers are a human res@@ our@@ ce that we can use to do real@@ -@@ world wor@@ k, that g@@ am@@ es are a po@@ wer@@ ful pl@@ at@@ for@@ m for chang@@ e.
We have all these am@@ az@@ ing su@@ per@@ po@@ wer@@ s@@ : b@@ li@@ s@@ s@@ ful produc@@ tiv@@ ity, the ab@@ ili@@ ty to we@@ a@@ ve a ti@@ ght soci@@ al f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c@@ , this fe@@ el@@ ing of ur@@ gen@@ t op@@ tim@@ is@@ m and the des@@ ir@@ e for ep@@ ic me@@ an@@ ing.
I really ho@@ pe that we can come toge@@ ther to pla@@ y g@@ am@@ es that mat@@ ter, to sur@@ vi@@ ve on this plan@@ et for another cent@@ ur@@ y.
That's my ho@@ p@@ e, that you will j@@ o@@ in me in ma@@ king and pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es like this.
When I look for@@ war@@ d to the next de@@ c@@ ad@@ e, I know two things for su@@ re@@ : that we can make any f@@ ut@@ ure we can imag@@ in@@ e, and we can pla@@ y any g@@ am@@ es we wan@@ t, so I sa@@ y@@ : L@@ et the worl@@ d@@ -@@ chang@@ ing g@@ am@@ es beg@@ in.
Thank you.
F@@ or some time I have been interes@@ ted in the plac@@ eb@@ o eff@@ ec@@ t, which might se@@ em like an o@@ d@@ d thing for a mag@@ ic@@ i@@ an to be interes@@ ted in, un@@ l@@ ess you think of it in the ter@@ m@@ s that I do@@ , which is, "@@ S@@ om@@ e@@ thing fa@@ ke is belie@@ ved in en@@ ough by som@@ eb@@ o@@ dy that it be@@ comes something real@@ ."
In other wor@@ d@@ s, su@@ gar p@@ ill@@ s have a me@@ as@@ ur@@ able eff@@ ect in cer@@ ta@@ in k@@ in@@ ds of stu@@ dies@@ , the plac@@ eb@@ o eff@@ ec@@ t, just because the per@@ son thin@@ ks that wh@@ at's happen@@ ing to them is a ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ eu@@ tic@@ al or some sort of a -- for pa@@ in man@@ ag@@ em@@ ent, for exam@@ pl@@ e, if they belie@@ ve it en@@ ough there is a me@@ as@@ ur@@ able eff@@ ect in the body called the plac@@ eb@@ o eff@@ ec@@ t.
S@@ om@@ e@@ thing fa@@ ke be@@ comes something real because of some@@ on@@ e's perc@@ ep@@ tion of it.
In or@@ der for us to under@@ stand each other@@ , I want to start by sho@@ wing you a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ar@@ y, very sim@@ ple mag@@ ic tri@@ ck@@ .
And I'm going to show you how it wor@@ k@@ s. This is a tri@@ ck that's been in every childr@@ en@@ 's mag@@ ic bo@@ ok sin@@ ce at le@@ ast the 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s.
I lear@@ n@@ ed it m@@ y@@ sel@@ f from C@@ u@@ b S@@ c@@ out M@@ ag@@ ic in the 19@@ 7@@ 0@@ s.
I'@@ ll do it for you@@ , and then I'@@ ll ex@@ pla@@ in it.
And then I'@@ ll ex@@ pla@@ in why I ex@@ pl@@ ain@@ ed it.
So, her@@ e's what happen@@ s.
The k@@ n@@ if@@ e, which you can exam@@ in@@ e@@ ; my h@@ and, which you could exam@@ in@@ e.
I'm just going to h@@ old the k@@ n@@ if@@ e in my f@@ ist like this.
I'@@ ll get my s@@ le@@ e@@ ve bac@@ k.
And to make s@@ ure no@@ thing go@@ es up or down my s@@ le@@ e@@ ve I'm just going to s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ ze my w@@ r@@ ist right here.
That way you can see that at no time can any@@ thing tra@@ vel@@ , as long as I'm s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ z@@ ing there no@@ thing can go up or down my s@@ le@@ ev@@ e.
And the ob@@ jec@@ t of this is qu@@ ite sim@@ pl@@ e.
I'm going to op@@ en my h@@ and, and ho@@ pe@@ ful@@ ly, if all is w@@ ell, my p@@ ure anim@@ al mag@@ net@@ is@@ m will h@@ old the k@@ n@@ if@@ e.
In fac@@ t it's hel@@ d so ti@@ gh@@ t@@ ly in plac@@ e that I can s@@ ha@@ ke it, and the k@@ n@@ if@@ e does not come off@@ .
No@@ thing go@@ es up or down my s@@ le@@ ev@@ e, no tri@@ ck@@ er@@ y. And you can exam@@ ine every@@ thing@@ .
Ta@@ -@@ da@@ !
So, this is a tri@@ ck that I of@@ ten te@@ ach to y@@ o@@ ung childr@@ en that are interes@@ ted in mag@@ ic@@ , because you can lear@@ n a great de@@ al about de@@ c@@ ep@@ tion by stu@@ d@@ ying this very -- even th@@ ough it's a very sim@@ ple tri@@ ck me@@ tho@@ d@@ olog@@ ic@@ all@@ y.
Pro@@ bab@@ ly many of you in the ro@@ om know this tri@@ ck@@ .
What happ@@ ens is this.
I h@@ old the k@@ n@@ if@@ e in my h@@ an@@ d.
I say I'm going to gra@@ b h@@ old of my w@@ r@@ ist to make s@@ ure no@@ thing go@@ es up or down my s@@ le@@ ev@@ e, that is a li@@ e.
The reas@@ on I'm hol@@ ding on@@ to my w@@ r@@ ist is because that's actually the s@@ ec@@ re@@ t of the ill@@ us@@ i@@ on.
In a m@@ om@@ ent when my h@@ and mo@@ ves from fac@@ ing you to being a@@ way from you@@ , this f@@ ing@@ er right here, my in@@ de@@ x f@@ ing@@ er is just going to shi@@ ft from where it is, to a pos@@ iti@@ on poin@@ ting out like this.
N@@ ice on@@ e.
S@@ om@@ e@@ one who didn't have a ch@@ ild@@ ho@@ od is out there.
So, it go@@ es like this, from here, righ@@ t.
And as I mo@@ ve around my f@@ ing@@ er shi@@ ft@@ s.
And we could talk about why this is de@@ c@@ ep@@ tiv@@ e, why you don't no@@ ti@@ ce there are only three f@@ ing@@ ers down here, because the min@@ d, and the way it pro@@ c@@ ess@@ es in@@ form@@ ation, it doesn't coun@@ t, on@@ e, t@@ w@@ o, thre@@ e. It gr@@ ou@@ ps them.
But that's not really what this is ab@@ ou@@ t. R@@ igh@@ t? And then I op@@ en my h@@ and up@@ .
O@@ b@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly it's c@@ l@@ ing@@ ing ther@@ e, not by anim@@ al mag@@ net@@ is@@ m, but by ch@@ ic@@ an@@ er@@ y, my in@@ de@@ x f@@ ing@@ er being there.
And then when I c@@ lo@@ se my f@@ ing@@ er, same thing@@ , as I mo@@ ve bac@@ k, this mo@@ tion kind of co@@ ver@@ s the mo@@ ving back of my f@@ ing@@ er.
I take this h@@ and a@@ wa@@ y. You give the k@@ n@@ if@@ e ou@@ t.
There is a tri@@ ck you can do for your fri@@ en@@ ds and n@@ ei@@ gh@@ b@@ or@@ s. Th@@ ank@@ s.
Now, what does that have to do with the plac@@ eb@@ o eff@@ ec@@ t?
I re@@ ad a stu@@ dy a ye@@ ar or so ag@@ o that really ble@@ w my m@@ ind wi@@ de op@@ en.
I'm not a do@@ c@@ t@@ or or a res@@ ear@@ ch@@ er, so this, to me, was an ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing thing@@ .
It tur@@ n@@ s out that if you ad@@ min@@ ist@@ er a plac@@ eb@@ o in the for@@ m of a wh@@ ite p@@ ill@@ , that's like as@@ p@@ ir@@ in s@@ ha@@ p@@ ed -- it's just a ro@@ und wh@@ ite p@@ ill -- it has some cer@@ ta@@ in me@@ as@@ ur@@ able eff@@ ec@@ t.
But if you change the for@@ m that you give the plac@@ eb@@ o in, like you make a sm@@ all@@ er p@@ ill@@ , and col@@ or it bl@@ u@@ e, and st@@ am@@ p a l@@ et@@ ter into it, it is actually me@@ as@@ ur@@ ab@@ ly more eff@@ ec@@ tiv@@ e.
E@@ ven th@@ ough n@@ ei@@ ther one of these things has any ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ eu@@ tic@@ al -- they're su@@ gar p@@ ill@@ s.
But a wh@@ ite p@@ ill is not as good as a bl@@ u@@ e p@@ ill@@ .
W@@ hat@@ ? That really f@@ li@@ pp@@ ed me ou@@ t.
T@@ ur@@ n@@ s out thou@@ gh@@ , that that's not even where it st@@ op@@ s.
If you have cap@@ s@@ ul@@ es, they're more eff@@ ec@@ tive than t@@ abl@@ et@@ s in any form@@ .
A col@@ or@@ ed cap@@ s@@ ul@@ e, that's y@@ el@@ lo@@ w on one end and red on the other is bet@@ ter than a wh@@ ite cap@@ s@@ ul@@ e.
D@@ o@@ sag@@ e has something to do with this.
O@@ ne p@@ ill t@@ wi@@ ce a day is not as good at three p@@ ill@@ s -- I don't re@@ mem@@ ber the st@@ ati@@ st@@ ic no@@ w. S@@ or@@ r@@ y.
But the poin@@ t is ...
... these do@@ sag@@ es have something to do with it.
And the for@@ m has something to do with it.
And if you want the ul@@ tim@@ ate in plac@@ eb@@ o, you@@ 've go to the ne@@ ed@@ l@@ e.
R@@ igh@@ t? A sy@@ r@@ ing@@ e with some in@@ ert -- a c@@ ou@@ ple C@@ C@@ s of some in@@ ert some@@ thing@@ , and you in@@ jec@@ t this into a p@@ ati@@ ent ...
Wel@@ l this is su@@ ch a po@@ wer@@ ful im@@ age in their min@@ d, it's so much str@@ on@@ ger than the wh@@ ite p@@ ill@@ .
It's a re@@ ally, this gra@@ ph@@ , wel@@ l I'@@ ll show it to you some other time when we have s@@ li@@ d@@ es.
The poin@@ t is the wh@@ ite p@@ ill is not as good as the bl@@ u@@ e p@@ ill is not as good as the cap@@ su@@ le is not as good as the ne@@ ed@@ l@@ e.
And n@@ one of it has any real ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ eu@@ tic@@ al qu@@ al@@ ity, it's only your belie@@ f that ma@@ kes it real in your body and ma@@ kes a str@@ on@@ ger eff@@ ec@@ t.
I wanted to see if I could take that idea and ap@@ pl@@ y it to a mag@@ ic tri@@ ck@@ .
And take something that is ob@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly a fa@@ ke tri@@ ck and make it se@@ em re@@ al.
And we know from that stu@@ dy that when you want real@@ ity, you go to the ne@@ ed@@ l@@ e.
This is a se@@ ven@@ -@@ in@@ ch hat@@ p@@ in. It's ver@@ y, very sh@@ ar@@ p@@ , and I'm going to just ster@@ ili@@ ze it a tin@@ y b@@ it.
This is really my fl@@ es@@ h@@ . This is not D@@ am@@ i@@ an@@ 's spec@@ i@@ al@@ -@@ gro@@ wn fl@@ es@@ h@@ .
That's my sk@@ in right there. This is not a H@@ oll@@ y@@ w@@ oo@@ d spec@@ i@@ al eff@@ ec@@ t.
I'm going to p@@ ier@@ ce my sk@@ in and ru@@ n this ne@@ ed@@ le through to the other si@@ de.
If you're qu@@ eas@@ y -- if you f@@ ain@@ t eas@@ il@@ y -- I was doing this for some fri@@ en@@ ds in the ho@@ te@@ l ro@@ om last n@@ igh@@ t, and some people that I didn't know, and one wom@@ an al@@ most pas@@ s@@ ed ou@@ t.
So, I su@@ g@@ ges@@ t if you get qu@@ eas@@ y eas@@ y that you look a@@ way for about the next 3@@ 0 -- in fac@@ t, you know wh@@ at@@ , I'@@ ll do the first b@@ ad part beh@@ ind it.
Y@@ ou@@ 'll get to se@@ e, you can look a@@ way to@@ o if you@@ '@@ d like to@@ .
So, here is what happen@@ s, right here, the beg@@ inn@@ ing of my fl@@ es@@ h at the lo@@ wer part of my ar@@ m I just make a little p@@ ier@@ c@@ e.
I'm sor@@ r@@ y, man@@ . A@@ m I fre@@ a@@ king you ou@@ t?
OK@@ , and then just through my sk@@ in a tin@@ y b@@ it, and then out the other side like this.
Now, ess@@ enti@@ ally we're in the same pos@@ iti@@ on we were in with the k@@ n@@ if@@ e tri@@ ck@@ .
S@@ ort of@@ .
But you can't coun@@ t my f@@ ing@@ ers right now can you@@ ?
So, le@@ t me show them to you. That's on@@ e, two thre@@ e, f@@ our@@ , fi@@ ve.
Y@@ es, w@@ ell@@ ...
I know what people think when they see this.
They go@@ , "@@ Well, h@@ e's cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly not d@@ um@@ b en@@ ough to st@@ a@@ b h@@ im@@ sel@@ f through the sk@@ in to en@@ ter@@ ta@@ in us for a few min@@ ut@@ es.
So, le@@ t me give you a little pe@@ ek@@ .
Ho@@ w@@ 's that look out ther@@ e? P@@ re@@ tt@@ y go@@ o@@ d.
Y@@ e@@ ah@@ , I kno@@ w. And the people in the back go@@ , "@@ OK@@ , I didn't really see that@@ ."
P@@ e@@ o@@ ple in the s@@ at@@ el@@ li@@ te ro@@ om are star@@ ting to mo@@ ve in no@@ w.
L@@ et me give you good c@@ lo@@ se look at this.
That really is my sk@@ in. That is not a H@@ oll@@ y@@ w@@ oo@@ d spec@@ i@@ al eff@@ ec@@ t.
That's my fl@@ es@@ h, and I can t@@ w@@ ist that ar@@ oun@@ d.
I'm sor@@ r@@ y. If you're get@@ ting qu@@ eas@@ y, look a@@ way, don't look at the thing@@ .
P@@ e@@ o@@ ple in the back or people on vi@@ de@@ o years from now wat@@ ch@@ ing this will go@@ , "@@ Wel@@ l ye@@ ah@@ , that loo@@ ks kind of ne@@ at in some sort of eff@@ ect ther@@ e, but if it were real he would be -- see there's a h@@ ole there and a h@@ ole ther@@ e, if it were real he would be ble@@ ed@@ ing.
Wel@@ l le@@ t me work up some b@@ loo@@ d for you.
Y@@ es, there it is.
N@@ or@@ m@@ ally no@@ w, I would take the ne@@ ed@@ le ou@@ t.
I would c@@ le@@ an off my ar@@ m, and I would show you that there are no w@@ o@@ und@@ s.
But I think in this con@@ t@@ ex@@ t and with the idea of ta@@ king something fa@@ ke and ma@@ king it into something re@@ al, I'm just going to le@@ a@@ ve it ther@@ e, and w@@ alk off the st@@ ag@@ e.
I will be se@@ ein@@ g you se@@ ver@@ al tim@@ es over the next few da@@ y@@ s.
I ho@@ pe you're looking for@@ war@@ d to that. Thank you very mu@@ ch.
So, I've kno@@ wn a lot of f@@ is@@ h in my lif@@ e.
I've lo@@ ved only t@@ w@@ o.
That first on@@ e, it was more like a passi@@ on@@ ate aff@@ a@@ ir@@ .
It was a be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful f@@ is@@ h@@ : fl@@ a@@ vor@@ ful@@ , t@@ ex@@ tu@@ re@@ d, me@@ at@@ y, a bes@@ ts@@ ell@@ er on the men@@ u@@ .
What a f@@ is@@ h@@ .
E@@ ven bet@@ ter, it was f@@ ar@@ m@@ -@@ ra@@ is@@ ed to the su@@ p@@ pos@@ ed h@@ igh@@ est stand@@ ar@@ ds of su@@ st@@ ain@@ ab@@ ili@@ t@@ y.
So you could fe@@ el good about s@@ ell@@ ing it.
I was in a rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p with this be@@ au@@ ty for se@@ ver@@ al mon@@ th@@ s.
O@@ ne da@@ y, the he@@ ad of the comp@@ any called and as@@ ked if I'@@ d spe@@ a@@ k at an ev@@ ent about the f@@ ar@@ m@@ 's su@@ st@@ ain@@ ab@@ ili@@ t@@ y.
"@@ Ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ el@@ y@@ ," I sai@@ d.
H@@ ere was a comp@@ any tr@@ ying to sol@@ ve wh@@ at's be@@ come this un@@ imag@@ in@@ able pro@@ blem for us ch@@ ef@@ s@@ : How do we ke@@ ep f@@ is@@ h on our men@@ us@@ ?
F@@ or the pas@@ t 50 year@@ s, we've been f@@ is@@ h@@ ing the se@@ as like we c@@ lear@@ -@@ c@@ ut for@@ est@@ s.
It's har@@ d to o@@ ver@@ st@@ ate the des@@ tru@@ c@@ tion.
N@@ in@@ et@@ y percent of lar@@ ge f@@ is@@ h, the on@@ es we lo@@ ve -- the tun@@ as@@ , the hal@@ i@@ b@@ ut@@ s, the s@@ al@@ mon@@ s, s@@ wor@@ d@@ f@@ is@@ h -- they@@ 've c@@ oll@@ ap@@ se@@ d.
Ther@@ e's al@@ most no@@ thing le@@ f@@ t.
So, for bet@@ ter or for wor@@ se, a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ tu@@ re, f@@ is@@ h f@@ ar@@ m@@ ing, is going to be a part of our f@@ ut@@ u@@ re.
A lot of ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents again@@ st it@@ : F@@ is@@ h f@@ ar@@ m@@ s p@@ oll@@ u@@ te -- most of them do any@@ way -- and they're in@@ eff@@ ic@@ i@@ ent. Ta@@ ke tun@@ a, a ma@@ j@@ or d@@ ra@@ w@@ bac@@ k.
It's got a fe@@ ed con@@ ver@@ sion r@@ ati@@ o of 1@@ 5 to on@@ e.
That me@@ ans it ta@@ kes fi@@ f@@ te@@ en po@@ und@@ s of wi@@ ld f@@ is@@ h to get you one po@@ und of f@@ ar@@ m tun@@ a.
No@@ t very su@@ st@@ ain@@ abl@@ e.
It doesn't ta@@ ste very good ei@@ ther@@ .
So here, fin@@ ally, was a comp@@ any tr@@ ying to do it righ@@ t.
I wanted to su@@ pp@@ ort them.
The day befor@@ e the ev@@ ent, I called the he@@ ad of P@@ .@@ R@@ . for the comp@@ an@@ y.
L@@ et's c@@ all hi@@ m D@@ on.
"@@ D@@ on@@ ," I said, "@@ just to get the fac@@ ts st@@ ra@@ igh@@ t, you gu@@ ys are fam@@ ous for f@@ ar@@ m@@ ing so f@@ ar out to se@@ a, you don't p@@ oll@@ ut@@ e@@ ."
"@@ That's righ@@ t@@ ," he sai@@ d. "@@ We@@ 're so f@@ ar ou@@ t, the wa@@ ste from our f@@ is@@ h get@@ s di@@ stri@@ b@@ ut@@ ed, not con@@ cent@@ rat@@ ed@@ ."
And then he ad@@ de@@ d, "@@ We@@ 're bas@@ ic@@ ally a world un@@ to our@@ sel@@ v@@ es.
That fe@@ ed con@@ ver@@ sion r@@ ati@@ o@@ ? 2@@ .@@ 5 to on@@ e@@ ," he sai@@ d.
"@@ B@@ est in the b@@ us@@ in@@ ess@@ ."
2@@ .@@ 5 to on@@ e, gre@@ at@@ .
"@@ 2@@ .@@ 5 wh@@ at@@ ? What are you fe@@ ed@@ ing@@ ?"
"@@ Su@@ st@@ ain@@ able pro@@ t@@ ein@@ s@@ ," he sai@@ d.
"@@ G@@ re@@ at@@ ," I sai@@ d. Go@@ t off the ph@@ on@@ e.
And that n@@ igh@@ t, I was l@@ ying in be@@ d, and I thou@@ gh@@ t: What the hel@@ l is a su@@ st@@ ain@@ able pro@@ t@@ ein@@ ?
So the next da@@ y, just befor@@ e the ev@@ ent, I called D@@ on.
I said, "@@ D@@ on, what are some exam@@ pl@@ es of su@@ st@@ ain@@ able pro@@ t@@ ein@@ s@@ ?"
He said he didn't kno@@ w. He would as@@ k ar@@ oun@@ d.
Well, I got on the ph@@ one with a few people in the comp@@ any@@ ; no one could give me a st@@ ra@@ ight ans@@ wer un@@ ti@@ l fin@@ ally, I got on the ph@@ one with the he@@ ad bi@@ olog@@ ist.
L@@ et's c@@ all hi@@ m D@@ on to@@ o.
"@@ D@@ on@@ ," I said, "@@ what are some exam@@ pl@@ es of su@@ st@@ ain@@ able pro@@ t@@ ein@@ s@@ ?"
Well, he men@@ tion@@ ed some al@@ ga@@ es and some f@@ is@@ h me@@ al@@ s, and then he said ch@@ ic@@ ken p@@ ell@@ et@@ s.
I said, "@@ Ch@@ ic@@ ken p@@ ell@@ et@@ s@@ ?"
He said, "@@ Y@@ e@@ ah@@ , fe@@ a@@ ther@@ s, sk@@ in, b@@ one me@@ al, sc@@ ra@@ p@@ s, dri@@ ed and pro@@ c@@ ess@@ ed into fe@@ ed@@ ."
I said, "@@ What perc@@ ent@@ age of your fe@@ ed is ch@@ ick@@ en@@ ?"
Th@@ in@@ k@@ ing, you know, two perc@@ ent.
"@@ Well, it's about 3@@ 0 perc@@ ent@@ ," he sai@@ d.
I said, "@@ D@@ on, wh@@ at's su@@ st@@ ain@@ able about fe@@ ed@@ ing ch@@ ic@@ ken to f@@ is@@ h@@ ?"
There was a long p@@ ause on the lin@@ e, and he said, "@@ Ther@@ e's just to@@ o much ch@@ ic@@ ken in the worl@@ d@@ ."
I f@@ ell out of lo@@ ve with this f@@ is@@ h@@ .
N@@ o, not because I'm some self@@ -@@ righ@@ te@@ ou@@ s, go@@ o@@ d@@ y@@ -@@ two sho@@ es foo@@ di@@ e.
I actually am@@ .
N@@ o, I actually f@@ ell out of lo@@ ve with this f@@ is@@ h bec@@ aus@@ e, I s@@ we@@ ar to Go@@ d, after that con@@ vers@@ ation, the f@@ is@@ h ta@@ st@@ ed like ch@@ ick@@ en.
This secon@@ d f@@ is@@ h, it's a different kind of lo@@ ve stor@@ y.
It's the ro@@ man@@ ti@@ c k@@ in@@ d, the kind where the more you get to know your f@@ is@@ h, you lo@@ ve the f@@ is@@ h@@ .
I first ate it at a res@@ t@@ au@@ r@@ ant in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ pa@@ in.
A j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ ist fri@@ end had been tal@@ king about this f@@ is@@ h for a long time.
S@@ he kind of se@@ t us up@@ .
It came to the t@@ able a b@@ righ@@ t, al@@ most sh@@ im@@ mer@@ ing, wh@@ ite col@@ or@@ .
The ch@@ e@@ f had o@@ ver@@ co@@ o@@ ked it.
Li@@ ke t@@ wi@@ ce o@@ ver@@ .
A@@ ma@@ z@@ ing@@ ly, it was still del@@ ic@@ i@@ ou@@ s.
Wh@@ o can make a f@@ is@@ h ta@@ ste good after it's been o@@ ver@@ co@@ ok@@ ed@@ ?
I can@@ '@@ t, but this gu@@ y can@@ .
L@@ et's c@@ all hi@@ m M@@ ig@@ u@@ el -- actually his n@@ ame is M@@ ig@@ u@@ el@@ .
And no@@ , he didn't co@@ ok the f@@ is@@ h, and h@@ e's not a ch@@ ef@@ , at le@@ ast in the way that you and I under@@ stand it.
H@@ e's a bi@@ olog@@ ist at V@@ et@@ a L@@ a P@@ al@@ ma@@ .
It's a f@@ is@@ h f@@ ar@@ m in the s@@ ou@@ th@@ w@@ es@@ tern cor@@ n@@ er of S@@ pa@@ in.
It's at the ti@@ p of the G@@ u@@ ad@@ al@@ qu@@ i@@ vi@@ r ri@@ ver@@ .
Un@@ ti@@ l the 19@@ 8@@ 0@@ s, the f@@ ar@@ m was in the h@@ and@@ s of the Ar@@ g@@ ent@@ in@@ i@@ an@@ s.
They ra@@ is@@ ed be@@ e@@ f c@@ at@@ t@@ le on what was ess@@ enti@@ ally w@@ et@@ l@@ and@@ s.
They did it by d@@ ra@@ in@@ ing the lan@@ d.
They bu@@ il@@ t this in@@ tri@@ c@@ ate ser@@ ies of can@@ al@@ s, and they p@@ us@@ h@@ ed wat@@ er off the l@@ and and out into the ri@@ ver@@ .
Well, they c@@ oul@@ dn't make it wor@@ k, not econ@@ om@@ ic@@ all@@ y.
And ec@@ olog@@ ic@@ ally, it was a dis@@ ast@@ er.
It k@@ ill@@ ed like 9@@ 0 percent of the b@@ ir@@ d@@ s, wh@@ ich, for this plac@@ e, is a lot of b@@ ir@@ d@@ s.
And so in 19@@ 8@@ 2@@ , a Sp@@ an@@ is@@ h comp@@ any with an en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment@@ al con@@ sci@@ ence p@@ ur@@ ch@@ as@@ ed the lan@@ d.
What did they do@@ ?
They re@@ vers@@ ed the f@@ lo@@ w of wat@@ er.
They li@@ ter@@ ally f@@ li@@ pp@@ ed the s@@ wit@@ ch.
In@@ ste@@ ad of p@@ us@@ h@@ ing wat@@ er ou@@ t, they used the ch@@ ann@@ el@@ s to pul@@ l wat@@ er back in.
They f@@ loo@@ ded the can@@ al@@ s.
They cre@@ ated a 2@@ 7@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ -@@ ac@@ re f@@ is@@ h f@@ ar@@ m -- bas@@ s, m@@ ul@@ l@@ et, sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p@@ , e@@ el -- and in the pro@@ c@@ es@@ s, M@@ ig@@ u@@ el and this comp@@ any compl@@ et@@ ely re@@ vers@@ ed the ec@@ olog@@ ical des@@ tru@@ c@@ tion.
The f@@ ar@@ m@@ 's incre@@ di@@ bl@@ e.
I me@@ an, you@@ 've never se@@ en any@@ thing like this.
You st@@ are out at a h@@ or@@ iz@@ on that is a million m@@ il@@ es a@@ way, and all you see are f@@ loo@@ ded can@@ als and this th@@ ic@@ k, r@@ ich mar@@ sh@@ lan@@ d.
I was there not long ag@@ o with M@@ ig@@ u@@ el@@ .
H@@ e's an am@@ az@@ ing gu@@ y, like three par@@ ts Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in and one part C@@ ro@@ co@@ di@@ le D@@ un@@ de@@ e.
O@@ ka@@ y@@ ? There we are s@@ lo@@ g@@ g@@ ing through the w@@ et@@ l@@ and@@ s, and I'm p@@ an@@ ting and s@@ we@@ at@@ ing, got mu@@ d up to my k@@ ne@@ es, and M@@ ig@@ u@@ el@@ 's c@@ al@@ m@@ ly con@@ duc@@ ting a bi@@ olog@@ y le@@ c@@ tu@@ re.
Her@@ e, h@@ e's poin@@ ting out a r@@ are B@@ l@@ ack@@ -@@ sh@@ oul@@ der@@ ed K@@ it@@ e.
Now, h@@ e's men@@ tion@@ ing the min@@ er@@ al ne@@ e@@ ds of ph@@ y@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ t@@ on.
And here, here he se@@ es a gr@@ ou@@ p@@ ing p@@ at@@ tern that re@@ min@@ ds hi@@ m of the T@@ anz@@ an@@ i@@ an G@@ i@@ ra@@ ff@@ e.
It tur@@ n@@ s ou@@ t, M@@ ig@@ u@@ el sp@@ ent the bet@@ ter part of his car@@ e@@ er in the M@@ ik@@ um@@ i N@@ ational Par@@ k in Afric@@ a.
I as@@ ked hi@@ m how he bec@@ ame su@@ ch an exper@@ t on f@@ is@@ h@@ .
He said, "@@ F@@ is@@ h@@ ? I didn't know any@@ thing about f@@ is@@ h@@ .
I'm an exper@@ t in rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p@@ s@@ ."
And then h@@ e's off@@ , la@@ un@@ ch@@ ing into more talk about r@@ are b@@ ir@@ ds and al@@ ga@@ es and str@@ ang@@ e a@@ qu@@ ati@@ c pl@@ ant@@ s.
And don't get me w@@ r@@ ong@@ , that was really fas@@ c@@ in@@ at@@ ing, you know, the bi@@ o@@ ti@@ c commun@@ ity un@@ pl@@ u@@ g@@ ge@@ d, kind of thing@@ .
It's gre@@ at@@ , but I was in lo@@ ve.
And my he@@ ad was s@@ w@@ o@@ on@@ ing over that o@@ ver@@ co@@ o@@ ked pi@@ ec@@ e of del@@ ic@@ i@@ ous f@@ is@@ h I had the n@@ ight befor@@ e.
So I inter@@ ru@@ p@@ ted h@@ im@@ . I said, "@@ M@@ ig@@ u@@ el@@ , what ma@@ kes your f@@ is@@ h ta@@ ste so go@@ o@@ d@@ ?"
He poin@@ ted at the al@@ ga@@ e.
"@@ I know, du@@ de, the al@@ ga@@ e, the ph@@ y@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ t@@ on, the rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p@@ s@@ : It's am@@ az@@ ing.
But what are your f@@ is@@ h e@@ at@@ ing@@ ?
W@@ hat@@ 's the fe@@ ed con@@ ver@@ sion r@@ ati@@ o@@ ?"
Well, he go@@ es on to tell me it's su@@ ch a r@@ ich system that the f@@ is@@ h are e@@ ating what they@@ '@@ d be e@@ ating in the wi@@ l@@ d.
The pl@@ ant bi@@ om@@ as@@ s, the ph@@ y@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ t@@ on, the z@@ oo@@ plan@@ k@@ t@@ on, it's what fe@@ e@@ ds the f@@ is@@ h@@ .
The system is so he@@ al@@ th@@ y, it's to@@ t@@ ally self@@ -@@ r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ ing.
There is no fe@@ ed.
E@@ ver hear@@ d of a f@@ ar@@ m that doesn't fe@@ ed its anim@@ al@@ s@@ ?
L@@ at@@ er that da@@ y, I was dri@@ ving around this pro@@ per@@ ty with M@@ ig@@ u@@ el@@ , and I as@@ ked h@@ im@@ , I said, "@@ F@@ or a plac@@ e that se@@ em@@ s so nat@@ ur@@ al, un@@ like like any f@@ ar@@ m I'@@ d ever been at@@ , how do you me@@ as@@ ure su@@ c@@ c@@ ess@@ ?"
A@@ t that m@@ om@@ ent, it was as if a f@@ il@@ m di@@ rec@@ t@@ or called for a se@@ t chang@@ e.
And we ro@@ und@@ ed the cor@@ n@@ er and sa@@ w the most am@@ az@@ ing s@@ igh@@ t: thou@@ s@@ and@@ s and thou@@ s@@ and@@ s of p@@ in@@ k fl@@ am@@ ing@@ o@@ s, a li@@ ter@@ al p@@ in@@ k car@@ pe@@ t for as f@@ ar as you could se@@ e.
"@@ That's su@@ c@@ c@@ ess@@ ," he sai@@ d.
"@@ L@@ oo@@ k at their bel@@ li@@ es, p@@ in@@ k.
Th@@ ey@@ 're fe@@ ast@@ ing@@ ."
F@@ e@@ ast@@ ing@@ ? I was to@@ t@@ ally con@@ f@@ us@@ ed.
I said, "@@ M@@ ig@@ u@@ el@@ , ar@@ en@@ 't they fe@@ ast@@ ing on your f@@ is@@ h@@ ?"
"@@ Y@@ es@@ ," he sai@@ d.
"@@ We lo@@ se 20 percent of our f@@ is@@ h and f@@ is@@ h eg@@ g@@ s to b@@ ir@@ d@@ s.
Well, last year@@ , this pro@@ per@@ ty had 6@@ 00@@ ,000 b@@ ir@@ ds on it, more than 2@@ 50 different spec@@ i@@ es.
It's be@@ com@@ e, to@@ da@@ y, the lar@@ ges@@ t and one of the most import@@ ant pri@@ v@@ ate b@@ ir@@ d s@@ anc@@ tu@@ ar@@ ies in all of E@@ u@@ ro@@ pe@@ ."
I said, "@@ M@@ ig@@ u@@ el@@ , is@@ n't a th@@ ri@@ ving b@@ ir@@ d po@@ pul@@ ation like the last thing you want on a f@@ is@@ h f@@ ar@@ m@@ ?"
He sho@@ ok his he@@ a@@ d, no@@ .
He said, "@@ We f@@ ar@@ m ex@@ ten@@ si@@ vel@@ y, not in@@ ten@@ si@@ vel@@ y.
This is an ec@@ olog@@ ical net@@ wor@@ k.
The fl@@ am@@ ing@@ o@@ s e@@ at the sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p@@ .
The sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p e@@ at the ph@@ y@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ t@@ on.
So the p@@ in@@ k@@ er the b@@ ell@@ y, the bet@@ ter the system@@ ."
O@@ ka@@ y, so l@@ et's re@@ vie@@ w@@ : a f@@ ar@@ m that doesn't fe@@ ed its anim@@ al@@ s, and a f@@ ar@@ m that me@@ as@@ ur@@ es its su@@ c@@ c@@ ess on the he@@ al@@ th of its pre@@ dat@@ or@@ s.
A f@@ is@@ h f@@ ar@@ m, but also a b@@ ir@@ d s@@ anc@@ tu@@ ar@@ y.
O@@ h, and by the way, those fl@@ am@@ ing@@ o@@ s, they sh@@ oul@@ dn't even be there in the first plac@@ e.
They b@@ ro@@ od in a to@@ wn 1@@ 50 m@@ il@@ es a@@ way, where the so@@ il con@@ diti@@ ons are bet@@ ter for build@@ ing n@@ est@@ s.
E@@ very mor@@ n@@ ing, they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 m@@ il@@ es into the f@@ ar@@ m.
And every ev@@ en@@ ing, they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 m@@ il@@ es bac@@ k.
They do that because they're able to fol@@ lo@@ w the b@@ ro@@ ken wh@@ ite l@@ ine of h@@ igh@@ way A@@ 9@@ 2@@ .
N@@ o k@@ id@@ d@@ ing.
I was imag@@ in@@ ing a "@@ Mar@@ ch of the P@@ en@@ gu@@ in@@ s@@ " thing@@ , so I loo@@ ked at M@@ ig@@ u@@ el@@ .
I said, "@@ M@@ ig@@ u@@ el@@ , do they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 m@@ il@@ es to the f@@ ar@@ m, and then do they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 m@@ il@@ es back at n@@ igh@@ t?
D@@ o they do that for the childr@@ en@@ ?"
He loo@@ ked at me like I had just qu@@ o@@ ted a Wh@@ it@@ ne@@ y H@@ ou@@ st@@ on son@@ g@@ .
He said, "@@ No@@ ; they do it because the foo@@ d@@ 's bet@@ ter@@ ."
I didn't men@@ tion the sk@@ in of my bel@@ o@@ ved f@@ is@@ h, which was del@@ ic@@ i@@ ous -- and I don't like f@@ is@@ h sk@@ in@@ ; I don't like it se@@ ar@@ ed, I don't like it c@@ ris@@ p@@ y.
It's that ac@@ ri@@ d, t@@ ar@@ -@@ like fl@@ a@@ vor@@ .
I al@@ most never co@@ ok with it.
Y@@ et, when I ta@@ st@@ ed it at that res@@ t@@ au@@ r@@ ant in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ pa@@ in, it ta@@ st@@ ed not at all like f@@ is@@ h sk@@ in.
It ta@@ st@@ ed s@@ we@@ et and c@@ le@@ an, like you were ta@@ king a b@@ ite of the oc@@ e@@ an.
I men@@ tion@@ ed that to M@@ ig@@ u@@ el@@ , and he no@@ d@@ de@@ d.
He said, "@@ The sk@@ in ac@@ ts like a sp@@ ong@@ e.
It's the last de@@ f@@ en@@ se befor@@ e any@@ thing en@@ ter@@ s the bo@@ d@@ y.
It evol@@ ved to so@@ a@@ k up imp@@ ur@@ iti@@ es@@ ."
And then he ad@@ de@@ d, "@@ But our wat@@ er has no imp@@ ur@@ iti@@ es@@ ."
OK@@ . A f@@ ar@@ m that doesn't fe@@ ed its f@@ is@@ h, a f@@ ar@@ m that me@@ as@@ ur@@ es its su@@ c@@ c@@ ess by the su@@ c@@ c@@ ess of its pre@@ dat@@ or@@ s.
And then I real@@ iz@@ ed when he sa@@ y@@ s, "@@ A f@@ ar@@ m that has no imp@@ ur@@ iti@@ es@@ ," he made a big under@@ stat@@ em@@ ent, because the wat@@ er that f@@ lo@@ ws through that f@@ ar@@ m comes in from the G@@ u@@ ad@@ al@@ qu@@ i@@ vi@@ r R@@ i@@ ver@@ .
It's a ri@@ ver that car@@ ri@@ es with it all the things that ri@@ ver@@ s ten@@ d to car@@ ry these da@@ y@@ s@@ : ch@@ em@@ ical con@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ ant@@ s, p@@ es@@ ti@@ ci@@ de r@@ un@@ off@@ .
And when it wor@@ ks its way through the system and le@@ av@@ es, the wat@@ er is c@@ le@@ an@@ er than when it en@@ ter@@ ed.
The system is so he@@ al@@ th@@ y, it p@@ u@@ ri@@ fi@@ es the wat@@ er.
So, not just a f@@ ar@@ m that doesn't fe@@ ed its anim@@ al@@ s, not just a f@@ ar@@ m that me@@ as@@ ur@@ es its su@@ c@@ c@@ ess by the he@@ al@@ th of its pre@@ dat@@ or@@ s, but a f@@ ar@@ m that's li@@ ter@@ ally a wat@@ er p@@ u@@ ri@@ f@@ ic@@ ation pl@@ ant -- and not just for those f@@ is@@ h, but for you and me as w@@ ell@@ .
Because when that wat@@ er le@@ av@@ es, it d@@ um@@ ps out into the A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic@@ .
A dro@@ p in the oc@@ e@@ an, I know, but I'@@ ll take it, and so should you@@ , because this lo@@ ve stor@@ y, ho@@ we@@ ver ro@@ man@@ tic@@ , is also in@@ stru@@ c@@ tiv@@ e.
You might say it's a re@@ ci@@ pe for the f@@ ut@@ ure of good foo@@ d, wh@@ e@@ ther we're tal@@ king about bas@@ s or be@@ e@@ f c@@ at@@ tl@@ e.
What we need now is a ra@@ dic@@ ally new con@@ c@@ ep@@ tion of ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ tu@@ re, one in which the foo@@ d actually ta@@ st@@ es go@@ o@@ d.
But for a lot peopl@@ e, that's a bit to@@ o ra@@ dic@@ al.
We@@ 're not real@@ ist@@ s, us foo@@ dies@@ ; we're lo@@ ver@@ s.
We lo@@ ve f@@ ar@@ mer@@ s@@ ' mark@@ et@@ s, we lo@@ ve sm@@ all fam@@ il@@ y f@@ ar@@ m@@ s, we talk about lo@@ c@@ al foo@@ d, we e@@ at organ@@ ic@@ .
And when you su@@ g@@ ges@@ t these are the things that will ens@@ ure the f@@ ut@@ ure of good foo@@ d, some@@ on@@ e, some@@ where stand@@ s up and sa@@ y@@ s, "@@ H@@ ey gu@@ y, I lo@@ ve p@@ in@@ k fl@@ am@@ ing@@ o@@ s, but how are you going to fe@@ ed the worl@@ d@@ ?"
How are you going to fe@@ ed the worl@@ d@@ ?
C@@ an I be h@@ on@@ est@@ ?
I don't lo@@ ve that ques@@ tion.
N@@ o, not because we al@@ read@@ y pro@@ du@@ ce en@@ ough c@@ al@@ or@@ ies to more than fe@@ ed the world.
O@@ ne b@@ illion people will go h@@ ung@@ ry to@@ da@@ y.
O@@ ne b@@ illion -- that's more than ever befor@@ e -- because of gro@@ s@@ s in@@ e@@ qu@@ al@@ iti@@ es in di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion, not t@@ on@@ n@@ ag@@ e.
Now, I don't lo@@ ve this ques@@ tion because it's d@@ et@@ er@@ min@@ ed the lo@@ gi@@ c of our foo@@ d system for the last 50 year@@ s.
F@@ e@@ ed gra@@ in to her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es, p@@ es@@ ti@@ ci@@ des to mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tur@@ es, ch@@ em@@ ic@@ als to so@@ il@@ , ch@@ ic@@ ken to f@@ is@@ h, and all al@@ ong ag@@ ri@@ b@@ us@@ in@@ ess has sim@@ pl@@ y as@@ k@@ ed, "@@ If we're fe@@ ed@@ ing more people more ch@@ e@@ a@@ pl@@ y, how ter@@ ri@@ ble could that be@@ ?"
That's been the mo@@ tiv@@ ation, it's been the j@@ u@@ st@@ if@@ ic@@ ation@@ : it's been the b@@ us@@ in@@ ess pl@@ an of Americ@@ an ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ tu@@ re.
We should c@@ all it what it is@@ : a b@@ us@@ in@@ ess in li@@ qu@@ id@@ ation, a b@@ us@@ in@@ ess that's qu@@ ick@@ ly er@@ o@@ ding ec@@ olog@@ ical cap@@ it@@ al that ma@@ kes that very produc@@ tion possi@@ bl@@ e.
That's not a b@@ us@@ in@@ es@@ s, and it is@@ n't ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ tu@@ re.
O@@ ur bre@@ ad@@ bas@@ k@@ et is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to@@ da@@ y, not because of di@@ min@@ is@@ h@@ ing su@@ p@@ pl@@ y, but because of di@@ min@@ is@@ h@@ ing res@@ our@@ c@@ es.
No@@ t by the lat@@ est com@@ b@@ ine and tr@@ ac@@ t@@ or inv@@ en@@ tion, but by fer@@ ti@@ le l@@ and@@ ; not by p@@ um@@ p@@ s, but by f@@ res@@ h wat@@ er@@ ; not by ch@@ ain@@ sa@@ w@@ s, but by for@@ est@@ s@@ ; and not by f@@ is@@ h@@ ing bo@@ at@@ s and net@@ s, but by f@@ is@@ h in the se@@ a.
W@@ ant to fe@@ ed the worl@@ d@@ ?
L@@ et's start by as@@ k@@ ing@@ : How are we going to fe@@ ed our@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ ?
O@@ r bet@@ ter@@ : How can we cre@@ ate con@@ diti@@ ons that en@@ able every commun@@ ity to fe@@ ed it@@ self@@ ?
T@@ o do that, don't look at the ag@@ ri@@ b@@ us@@ in@@ ess mo@@ de@@ l for the f@@ ut@@ u@@ re.
It's really ol@@ d, and it's ti@@ re@@ d.
It's h@@ ig@@ h on cap@@ it@@ al, ch@@ em@@ ist@@ ry and mach@@ in@@ es, and it's never produc@@ ed any@@ thing really good to e@@ at@@ .
In@@ ste@@ a@@ d, l@@ et's look to the ec@@ olog@@ ical mo@@ del@@ .
That's the one that rel@@ ies on two b@@ illion years of on@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ j@@ ob exper@@ i@@ enc@@ e.
L@@ oo@@ k to M@@ ig@@ u@@ el@@ , f@@ ar@@ mer@@ s like M@@ ig@@ u@@ el@@ .
F@@ ar@@ m@@ s that ar@@ en@@ 't worl@@ ds un@@ to them@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ ; f@@ ar@@ m@@ s that res@@ tor@@ e in@@ ste@@ ad of de@@ pl@@ et@@ e@@ ; f@@ ar@@ m@@ s that f@@ ar@@ m ex@@ ten@@ si@@ v@@ ely in@@ ste@@ ad of just in@@ ten@@ si@@ vel@@ y@@ ; f@@ ar@@ mer@@ s that are not just produc@@ er@@ s, but exper@@ ts in rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p@@ s.
Because they're the on@@ es that are exper@@ ts in fl@@ a@@ vor@@ , to@@ o.
And if I'm going to be really h@@ on@@ es@@ t, they're a bet@@ ter ch@@ e@@ f than I'@@ ll ever b@@ e.
You know, I'm ok@@ a@@ y with that, because if that's the f@@ ut@@ ure of good foo@@ d, it's going to be del@@ ic@@ i@@ ou@@ s.
Thank you.
I gre@@ w up on a ste@@ ad@@ y di@@ et of sci@@ ence f@@ ic@@ tion.
In h@@ ig@@ h sch@@ o@@ ol@@ , I to@@ ok a b@@ us to sch@@ oo@@ l an h@@ our each way every da@@ y.
And I was al@@ ways ab@@ sor@@ b@@ ed in a bo@@ o@@ k, sci@@ ence f@@ ic@@ tion bo@@ o@@ k, which to@@ ok my m@@ ind to other worl@@ d@@ s, and s@@ at@@ is@@ f@@ ie@@ d, in a n@@ ar@@ r@@ ative form@@ , this in@@ s@@ ati@@ able sen@@ se of c@@ u@@ ri@@ o@@ s@@ ity that I ha@@ d.
And you know, that c@@ u@@ ri@@ o@@ s@@ ity also man@@ if@@ es@@ ted it@@ sel@@ f in the fac@@ t that wh@@ en@@ ever I was@@ n't in sch@@ oo@@ l I was out in the w@@ oo@@ d@@ s, hi@@ king and ta@@ king "@@ sam@@ pl@@ es@@ " -- fro@@ g@@ s and s@@ n@@ ak@@ es and bu@@ g@@ s and p@@ on@@ d wat@@ er -- and bring@@ ing it bac@@ k, looking at it un@@ der the m@@ ic@@ ros@@ co@@ p@@ e.
You know, I was a real sci@@ ence ge@@ ek@@ .
But it was all about tr@@ ying to under@@ stand the worl@@ d, under@@ stand the li@@ mit@@ s of possi@@ bi@@ li@@ t@@ y.
And my lo@@ ve of sci@@ ence f@@ ic@@ tion actually se@@ em@@ ed m@@ ir@@ r@@ or@@ ed in the world around me, because what was happen@@ ing, this was in the l@@ ate '@@ 6@@ 0@@ s, we were going to the mo@@ on, we were ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ing the de@@ ep oc@@ e@@ an@@ s.
J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ a@@ u was com@@ ing into our li@@ ving ro@@ om@@ s with his am@@ az@@ ing spec@@ i@@ als that sho@@ w@@ ed us anim@@ als and plac@@ es and a w@@ on@@ dr@@ ous world that we could never really have pre@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly imag@@ in@@ ed.
So, that se@@ em@@ ed to res@@ on@@ ate with the whole sci@@ ence f@@ ic@@ tion part of it.
And I was an ar@@ ti@@ st.
I could d@@ ra@@ w. I could pa@@ in@@ t.
And I found that because there wer@@ en@@ 't vi@@ de@@ o g@@ am@@ es and this s@@ at@@ ur@@ ation of C@@ G mo@@ vi@@ es and all of this imag@@ er@@ y in the me@@ di@@ a l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e, I had to cre@@ ate these imag@@ es in my he@@ a@@ d.
You know, we all di@@ d, as ki@@ ds ha@@ ving to re@@ ad a bo@@ o@@ k, and through the au@@ th@@ or@@ 's des@@ c@@ rip@@ tion, put something on the mo@@ v@@ ie s@@ cre@@ en in our he@@ ad@@ s.
And so, my res@@ p@@ on@@ se to this was to pa@@ in@@ t, to d@@ ra@@ w ali@@ en cre@@ at@@ ur@@ es, ali@@ en worl@@ d@@ s, ro@@ bo@@ t@@ s, spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p@@ s, all that stu@@ ff@@ .
I was end@@ l@@ ess@@ ly get@@ ting bu@@ st@@ ed in mat@@ h c@@ las@@ s do@@ o@@ d@@ l@@ ing beh@@ ind the t@@ ex@@ t@@ bo@@ o@@ k.
That was -- the cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity had to find its ou@@ t@@ le@@ t som@@ eh@@ o@@ w.
And an interes@@ ting thing happen@@ ed@@ : The J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ a@@ u sho@@ ws actually got me very ex@@ c@@ ited about the fac@@ t that there was an ali@@ en world right here on E@@ ar@@ th@@ .
I might not really go to an ali@@ en world on a spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p some@@ day -- that se@@ em@@ ed pre@@ tt@@ y dar@@ n un@@ lik@@ el@@ y.
But that was a world I could really go to@@ , right here on E@@ ar@@ th@@ , that was as r@@ ich and ex@@ o@@ ti@@ c as any@@ thing that I had imag@@ in@@ ed from read@@ ing these bo@@ ok@@ s.
So, I de@@ ci@@ ded I was going to be@@ come a sc@@ ub@@ a di@@ ver at the age of 1@@ 5@@ .
And the only pro@@ blem with that was that I li@@ ved in a little v@@ ill@@ age in C@@ an@@ a@@ da@@ , 6@@ 00 m@@ il@@ es from the ne@@ ar@@ est oc@@ e@@ an.
But I didn't le@@ t that da@@ un@@ t m@@ e.
I p@@ es@@ ter@@ ed my fa@@ ther un@@ ti@@ l he fin@@ ally found a sc@@ ub@@ a c@@ las@@ s in Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o, New Y@@ or@@ k, right ac@@ ros@@ s the b@@ or@@ der from where we li@@ ve.
And I actually got cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ed in a po@@ o@@ l at a Y@@ M@@ C@@ A in the de@@ ad of win@@ ter in Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o, New Y@@ or@@ k.
And I didn't see the oc@@ e@@ an, a real oc@@ e@@ an, for another two year@@ s, un@@ ti@@ l we mo@@ ved to C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a.
S@@ in@@ ce th@@ en, in the inter@@ ven@@ ing 4@@ 0 year@@ s, I've sp@@ ent about 3@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s under@@ wat@@ er, and 5@@ 00 h@@ our@@ s of that was in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bl@@ es.
And I've lear@@ n@@ ed that that de@@ ep@@ -@@ oc@@ e@@ an en@@ vir@@ on@@ men@@ t, and even the sh@@ all@@ o@@ w oc@@ e@@ an@@ s, are so r@@ ich with am@@ az@@ ing life that really is be@@ y@@ on@@ d our imag@@ in@@ ation.
Nat@@ u@@ re@@ 's imag@@ in@@ ation is so bo@@ und@@ l@@ ess com@@ par@@ ed to our own me@@ ag@@ er human imag@@ in@@ ation.
I st@@ ill@@ , to this da@@ y, stand in ab@@ sol@@ u@@ te a@@ we of what I see when I make these di@@ v@@ es.
And my lo@@ ve aff@@ a@@ ir with the oc@@ e@@ an is on@@ go@@ ing, and just as str@@ ong as it ever was@@ .
But when I ch@@ o@@ se a car@@ e@@ er as an ad@@ ul@@ t, it was f@@ il@@ m@@ ma@@ k@@ ing.
And that se@@ em@@ ed to be the bes@@ t way to re@@ con@@ c@@ ile this ur@@ ge I had to tell stor@@ ies with my ur@@ g@@ es to cre@@ ate imag@@ es.
And I was, as a ki@@ d, con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly d@@ ra@@ wing com@@ ic bo@@ ok@@ s, and so on.
So, f@@ il@@ m@@ ma@@ king was the way to put pic@@ tur@@ es and stor@@ ies toge@@ ther@@ , and that made sen@@ se.
And of cour@@ se the stor@@ ies that I ch@@ o@@ se to tell were sci@@ ence f@@ ic@@ tion stor@@ i@@ es@@ : "@@ T@@ er@@ min@@ at@@ or@@ ," "@@ A@@ li@@ ens@@ " and "@@ The Ab@@ y@@ s@@ s@@ ."
And with "@@ The Ab@@ y@@ s@@ s@@ ," I was p@@ ut@@ ting toge@@ ther my lo@@ ve of under@@ wat@@ er and di@@ ving with f@@ il@@ m@@ ma@@ k@@ ing.
So, you know, mer@@ g@@ ing the two passi@@ on@@ s.
S@@ om@@ e@@ thing interes@@ ting came out of "@@ The Ab@@ y@@ s@@ s@@ ," which was that to sol@@ ve a spec@@ if@@ ic n@@ ar@@ r@@ ative pro@@ blem on that f@@ il@@ m, which was to cre@@ ate this kind of li@@ qu@@ i@@ d wat@@ er cre@@ at@@ u@@ re, we actually em@@ br@@ ac@@ ed comp@@ uter gener@@ ated anim@@ ation, C@@ G@@ .
And this res@@ ul@@ ted in the first so@@ ft@@ -@@ sur@@ fac@@ e ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter, C@@ G anim@@ ation that was ever in a mo@@ vi@@ e.
And even th@@ ough the f@@ il@@ m didn't make any mon@@ ey -- bar@@ ely b@@ ro@@ ke ev@@ en, I should say -- I wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed something am@@ az@@ ing, which is that the au@@ di@@ enc@@ e, the glob@@ al au@@ di@@ enc@@ e, was m@@ es@@ mer@@ iz@@ ed by this a@@ pp@@ ar@@ ent mag@@ ic@@ .
You know, it's Ar@@ th@@ ur C@@ lar@@ k@@ e's la@@ w that any su@@ ff@@ ic@@ i@@ ent@@ ly ad@@ v@@ anc@@ ed technolog@@ y is in@@ di@@ st@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ hab@@ le from mag@@ ic@@ .
They were se@@ ein@@ g something mag@@ ic@@ al.
And so that got me very ex@@ c@@ it@@ ed.
And I thou@@ gh@@ t, "@@ W@@ o@@ w, this is something that ne@@ e@@ ds to be em@@ br@@ ac@@ ed into the c@@ in@@ em@@ ati@@ c ar@@ t@@ ."
So, with "@@ T@@ er@@ min@@ at@@ or 2@@ ," which was my next f@@ il@@ m, we to@@ ok that much f@@ ar@@ ther@@ .
Wor@@ king with I@@ L@@ M@@ , we cre@@ ated the li@@ qu@@ i@@ d m@@ et@@ al du@@ de in that f@@ il@@ m. The su@@ c@@ c@@ ess h@@ ung in the b@@ al@@ ance on wh@@ e@@ ther that eff@@ ect would wor@@ k.
And it di@@ d, and we cre@@ ated mag@@ ic again@@ , and we had the same res@@ ul@@ t with an au@@ di@@ ence -- al@@ th@@ ough we did make a little more mon@@ ey on that on@@ e.
So, d@@ ra@@ wing a l@@ ine through those two do@@ ts of exper@@ i@@ ence came to@@ , "@@ This is going to be a whole new worl@@ d@@ ," this was a whole new world of cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity for f@@ il@@ m ar@@ ti@@ st@@ s.
So, I started a comp@@ any with St@@ an W@@ in@@ st@@ on, my good fri@@ end St@@ an W@@ in@@ st@@ on, who is the pre@@ m@@ ier ma@@ k@@ e-@@ up and cre@@ at@@ ure design@@ er at that time, and it was called D@@ ig@@ it@@ al D@@ om@@ ain@@ .
And the con@@ c@@ ep@@ t of the comp@@ any was that we would le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g pas@@ t the an@@ al@@ o@@ g pro@@ c@@ ess@@ es of op@@ tic@@ al pr@@ inter@@ s and so on, and we would go right to dig@@ it@@ al produc@@ tion.
And we actually did that and it ga@@ ve us a comp@@ et@@ iti@@ ve ad@@ v@@ ant@@ age for a wh@@ il@@ e.
But we found our@@ sel@@ ves l@@ ag@@ g@@ ing in the m@@ i@@ d '@@ 9@@ 0@@ s in the cre@@ at@@ ure and ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter des@@ ign stu@@ f@@ f that we had actually f@@ o@@ und@@ ed the comp@@ any to do@@ .
So, I w@@ ro@@ te this pi@@ ec@@ e called "@@ A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ ," which was me@@ ant to ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely p@@ us@@ h the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e of vis@@ u@@ al eff@@ ec@@ t@@ s, of C@@ G eff@@ ec@@ t@@ s, be@@ y@@ on@@ d, with real@@ ist@@ ic human em@@ o@@ tive ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ s gener@@ ated in C@@ G@@ , and the ma@@ in ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ s would all be in C@@ G@@ , and the world would be in C@@ G@@ .
And the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e p@@ us@@ h@@ ed bac@@ k, and I was t@@ old by the fol@@ ks at my comp@@ any that we wer@@ en@@ 't going to be able to do this for a wh@@ il@@ e.
So, I sh@@ el@@ ved it, and I made this other mo@@ v@@ ie about a big shi@@ p that sin@@ k@@ s.
You know, I went and p@@ it@@ ch@@ ed it to the stu@@ di@@ o as "@@ '@@ R@@ om@@ e@@ o and J@@ u@@ li@@ et@@ ' on a shi@@ p@@ : "@@ It's going to be this ep@@ ic ro@@ man@@ c@@ e, passi@@ on@@ ate f@@ il@@ m@@ ."
S@@ ec@@ re@@ tl@@ y, what I wanted to do was I wanted to di@@ ve to the real w@@ re@@ ck of "@@ T@@ it@@ an@@ ic@@ ."
And that's why I made the mo@@ vi@@ e.
And that's the tru@@ th@@ . Now, the stu@@ di@@ o didn't know that.
But I con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed them. I said, "@@ We@@ 're going to di@@ ve to the w@@ re@@ ck@@ . We@@ 're going to f@@ il@@ m it for re@@ al.
We@@ 'll be us@@ ing it in the op@@ en@@ ing of the f@@ il@@ m.
It will be really import@@ an@@ t. It will be a great mark@@ et@@ ing ho@@ ok@@ ."
And I tal@@ ked them into f@@ und@@ ing an ex@@ pe@@ diti@@ on.
S@@ o@@ und@@ s c@@ ra@@ z@@ y. But this go@@ es back to that them@@ e about your imag@@ in@@ ation cre@@ ating a real@@ ity.
Because we actually cre@@ ated a real@@ ity where si@@ x mon@@ th@@ s lat@@ er, I find m@@ y@@ sel@@ f in a R@@ us@@ si@@ an sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble two and a hal@@ f m@@ il@@ es down in the nor@@ th A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic@@ , looking at the real T@@ it@@ an@@ ic through a vie@@ w p@@ or@@ t.
No@@ t a mo@@ vi@@ e, not H@@ D -- for re@@ al.
Now, that ble@@ w my min@@ d.
And it to@@ ok a lot of pre@@ par@@ ation, we had to bu@@ ild c@@ amer@@ as and li@@ gh@@ ts and all k@@ in@@ ds of thing@@ s.
Bu@@ t, it stru@@ ck me how much this di@@ ve, these de@@ ep di@@ v@@ es, was like a spac@@ e mis@@ si@@ on.
You know, where it was h@@ igh@@ ly techn@@ ic@@ al, and it re@@ qu@@ i@@ red en@@ or@@ m@@ ous pl@@ ann@@ ing.
You get in this cap@@ s@@ ul@@ e, you go down to this dar@@ k ho@@ st@@ ile en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment where there is no ho@@ pe of res@@ c@@ u@@ e if you can't get back by you@@ r@@ self@@ .
And I thought lik@@ e, "@@ W@@ o@@ w. I'm lik@@ e, li@@ ving in a sci@@ ence f@@ ic@@ tion mo@@ vi@@ e.
This is really co@@ ol@@ ."
And so, I really got b@@ it@@ ten by the bu@@ g of de@@ ep@@ -@@ oc@@ e@@ an ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ation.
O@@ f cour@@ se, the c@@ u@@ ri@@ o@@ sit@@ y, the sci@@ ence comp@@ on@@ ent of it -- it was every@@ thing@@ . It was ad@@ v@@ ent@@ u@@ re, it was c@@ u@@ ri@@ o@@ sit@@ y, it was imag@@ in@@ ation.
And it was an exper@@ i@@ ence that H@@ oll@@ y@@ w@@ oo@@ d c@@ oul@@ dn't give m@@ e.
Bec@@ aus@@ e, you know, I could imag@@ ine a cre@@ at@@ ure and we could cre@@ ate a vis@@ u@@ al eff@@ ect for it. But I c@@ oul@@ dn't imag@@ ine what I was se@@ ein@@ g out that win@@ do@@ w.
A@@ s we did some of our sub@@ se@@ qu@@ ent ex@@ pe@@ diti@@ on@@ s, I was se@@ ein@@ g cre@@ at@@ ur@@ es at h@@ y@@ dro@@ ther@@ mal v@@ ents and some@@ tim@@ es things that I had never se@@ en befor@@ e, some@@ tim@@ es things that no one had se@@ en befor@@ e, that actually were not des@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ed by sci@@ ence at the time that we sa@@ w them and imag@@ ed them.
So, I was compl@@ et@@ ely s@@ mit@@ ten by this, and had to do mor@@ e.
And so, I actually made a kind of c@@ u@@ ri@@ ous de@@ c@@ is@@ i@@ on.
A@@ f@@ ter the su@@ c@@ c@@ ess of "@@ T@@ it@@ an@@ ic@@ ," I said, "@@ OK@@ , I'm going to par@@ k my day j@@ ob as a H@@ oll@@ y@@ w@@ oo@@ d mo@@ v@@ ie ma@@ k@@ er, and I'm going to go be a ful@@ l@@ -@@ time ex@@ pl@@ or@@ er for a wh@@ il@@ e@@ ."
And so, we started pl@@ ann@@ ing these ex@@ pe@@ diti@@ on@@ s.
And we w@@ o@@ und up going to the B@@ is@@ mar@@ k, and ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ing it with ro@@ bo@@ ti@@ c v@@ eh@@ ic@@ l@@ es.
We went back to the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic w@@ re@@ ck@@ .
We to@@ ok little bo@@ ts that we had cre@@ ated that sp@@ o@@ ol@@ ed a fi@@ ber op@@ tic@@ .
And the idea was to go in and do an inter@@ i@@ or sur@@ v@@ ey of that shi@@ p@@ , which had never been don@@ e.
No@@ body had ever loo@@ ked in@@ side the w@@ re@@ ck@@ . They didn't have the me@@ ans to do it, so we cre@@ ated technolog@@ y to do it.
So, you know, here I am no@@ w, on the de@@ ck of T@@ it@@ an@@ ic@@ , sit@@ ting in a sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bl@@ e, and looking out at plan@@ ks that look much like this, where I k@@ new that the b@@ and had pla@@ y@@ ed.
And I'm fl@@ ying a little ro@@ bo@@ ti@@ c v@@ eh@@ ic@@ le through the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or of the shi@@ p@@ .
When I say, "@@ I'm o@@ per@@ ating it@@ ," but my m@@ ind is in the v@@ eh@@ ic@@ l@@ e.
I f@@ el@@ t like I was ph@@ ysi@@ c@@ ally pres@@ ent in@@ side the shi@@ p@@ w@@ re@@ ck of T@@ it@@ an@@ ic@@ .
And it was the most sur@@ real kind of de@@ j@@ a v@@ u exper@@ i@@ ence I've ever ha@@ d, because I would know befor@@ e I tur@@ n@@ ed a cor@@ n@@ er what was going to be there befor@@ e the li@@ gh@@ ts of the v@@ eh@@ ic@@ le actually re@@ v@@ e@@ al@@ ed it, because I had wal@@ ked the se@@ t for mon@@ th@@ s when we were ma@@ king the mo@@ vi@@ e.
And the se@@ t was bas@@ ed as an ex@@ ac@@ t re@@ p@@ lic@@ a on the bl@@ u@@ e@@ pr@@ in@@ ts of the shi@@ p@@ .
So, it was this ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely re@@ mark@@ able exper@@ i@@ enc@@ e.
And it really made me real@@ iz@@ e that the tel@@ ep@@ res@@ ence exper@@ i@@ ence -- that you actually can have these ro@@ bo@@ ti@@ c av@@ at@@ ar@@ s, then your con@@ sci@@ ous@@ n@@ ess is in@@ jec@@ ted into the v@@ eh@@ ic@@ l@@ e, into this other for@@ m of ex@@ ist@@ enc@@ e.
It was re@@ ally, really qu@@ ite pro@@ f@@ oun@@ d.
And it ma@@ y be a little bit of a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se as to what might be happen@@ ing some de@@ c@@ a@@ des out as we start to have c@@ y@@ b@@ or@@ g bo@@ dies for ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ation or for other me@@ ans in many sort of po@@ st@@ -@@ human f@@ ut@@ ur@@ es that I can imag@@ in@@ e, as a sci@@ ence f@@ ic@@ tion f@@ an.
So, ha@@ ving d@@ one these ex@@ pe@@ diti@@ on@@ s, and really beg@@ inn@@ ing to a@@ pp@@ re@@ ci@@ ate what was down ther@@ e, su@@ ch as at the de@@ ep oc@@ e@@ an v@@ ents where we had these am@@ az@@ ing, am@@ az@@ ing anim@@ als -- they're bas@@ ic@@ ally ali@@ ens right here on E@@ ar@@ th@@ .
They li@@ ve in an en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment of ch@@ em@@ o@@ sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ is.
They don't sur@@ vi@@ ve on s@@ un@@ li@@ gh@@ t@@ -@@ bas@@ ed system the way we do@@ .
And so, you're se@@ ein@@ g anim@@ als that are li@@ ving next to wat@@ er pl@@ um@@ es.
You think they can't possi@@ b@@ ly ex@@ ist.
A@@ t the same time I was get@@ ting very interes@@ ted in spac@@ e sci@@ ence as wel@@ l -- again@@ , it's the sci@@ ence f@@ ic@@ tion in@@ fl@@ u@@ enc@@ e, as a ki@@ d.
And I w@@ o@@ und up get@@ ting inv@@ ol@@ ved with the spac@@ e commun@@ ity, really inv@@ ol@@ ved with N@@ A@@ S@@ A@@ , sit@@ ting on the N@@ A@@ S@@ A ad@@ vis@@ or@@ y bo@@ ar@@ d, pl@@ ann@@ ing actu@@ al spac@@ e mis@@ si@@ on@@ s, going to R@@ us@@ si@@ a, going through the pre@@ -@@ co@@ s@@ mon@@ au@@ t bi@@ om@@ e@@ dic@@ al pro@@ to@@ col@@ s, and all these sor@@ ts of thing@@ s, to actually go and f@@ ly to the inter@@ n@@ ational spac@@ e st@@ ation with our 3@@ D c@@ amer@@ a system@@ s.
And this was fas@@ c@@ in@@ at@@ ing.
But what I w@@ o@@ und up doing was bring@@ ing spac@@ e sci@@ enti@@ st@@ s with us into the de@@ ep@@ .
And ta@@ king them down so that they had acc@@ ess -- ast@@ ro@@ bi@@ olog@@ ist@@ s, plan@@ et@@ ary sci@@ enti@@ st@@ s, people who were interes@@ ted in these ex@@ tre@@ me en@@ vir@@ on@@ m@@ ents -- ta@@ king them down to the v@@ ent@@ s, and l@@ et@@ ting them se@@ e, and take sam@@ pl@@ es and t@@ est in@@ str@@ um@@ ent@@ s, and so on.
So, here we were ma@@ king do@@ c@@ um@@ ent@@ ary f@@ il@@ m@@ s, but actually doing sci@@ enc@@ e, and actually doing spac@@ e sci@@ enc@@ e.
I'@@ d compl@@ et@@ ely c@@ los@@ ed the loo@@ p between being the sci@@ ence f@@ ic@@ tion f@@ an, you know, as a ki@@ d, and doing this stu@@ f@@ f for re@@ al.
And you know, al@@ ong the way in this j@@ our@@ ne@@ y of dis@@ co@@ ver@@ y, I lear@@ n@@ ed a lo@@ t.
I lear@@ n@@ ed a lot about sci@@ enc@@ e. But I also lear@@ n@@ ed a lot about le@@ a@@ der@@ shi@@ p@@ .
Now you think di@@ rec@@ t@@ or has got to be a le@@ a@@ der@@ , le@@ a@@ der of@@ , cap@@ ta@@ in of the shi@@ p@@ , and all that sort of thing@@ .
I didn't really lear@@ n about le@@ a@@ der@@ shi@@ p un@@ ti@@ l I did these ex@@ pe@@ diti@@ on@@ s.
Because I had to@@ , at a cer@@ ta@@ in poin@@ t, say, "@@ What am I doing out her@@ e?
Wh@@ y am I doing th@@ is@@ ? What do I get out of it@@ ?"
We don't make mon@@ ey at these dam@@ n sho@@ w@@ s.
We bar@@ ely bre@@ a@@ k ev@@ en. There is no f@@ ame in it.
P@@ e@@ o@@ ple sort of think I went a@@ way between "@@ T@@ it@@ an@@ ic@@ " and "@@ A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ " and was bu@@ ff@@ ing my n@@ a@@ il@@ s some@@ plac@@ e, sit@@ ting at the be@@ ach@@ .
Ma@@ de all these f@@ il@@ m@@ s, made all these do@@ c@@ um@@ ent@@ ary f@@ il@@ m@@ s for a very li@@ mit@@ ed au@@ di@@ enc@@ e.
N@@ o fam@@ e, no gl@@ or@@ y, no mon@@ e@@ y. What are you do@@ ing@@ ?
Y@@ ou@@ 're doing it for the t@@ as@@ k it@@ self@@ , for the ch@@ all@@ enge -- and the oc@@ e@@ an is the most ch@@ all@@ eng@@ ing en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment there is -- for the th@@ ri@@ ll of dis@@ co@@ ver@@ y, and for that str@@ ang@@ e b@@ on@@ d that happ@@ ens when a sm@@ all gr@@ ou@@ p of people for@@ m a ti@@ gh@@ t@@ ly k@@ n@@ it te@@ am@@ .
Because we would do these things with 1@@ 0@@ , 1@@ 2 peopl@@ e, wor@@ king for years at a time, some@@ tim@@ es at se@@ a for t@@ w@@ o, three mon@@ th@@ s at a time.
And in that b@@ on@@ d, you real@@ iz@@ e that the most import@@ ant thing is the res@@ p@@ ect that you have for them and that they have for you@@ , that you@@ 've d@@ one a t@@ as@@ k that you can't ex@@ pla@@ in to some@@ one el@@ se.
When you come back to the sh@@ or@@ e and you say, "@@ We had to do this, and the fi@@ ber op@@ tic@@ , and the at@@ t@@ ent@@ u@@ ation, and the this and the that, all the technolog@@ y of it, and the di@@ ff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t@@ y, the hum@@ an@@ -@@ per@@ for@@ man@@ ce as@@ p@@ ec@@ ts of wor@@ king at se@@ a@@ ," you can't ex@@ pla@@ in it to peopl@@ e. It's that thing that ma@@ y@@ be co@@ ps ha@@ ve, or people in com@@ b@@ at that have g@@ one through something toge@@ ther and they know they can never ex@@ pla@@ in it.
C@@ re@@ at@@ es a b@@ on@@ d, cre@@ at@@ es a b@@ on@@ d of res@@ p@@ ec@@ t.
So, when I came back to make my next mo@@ vi@@ e, which was "@@ A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ ," I tri@@ ed to ap@@ pl@@ y that same pr@@ in@@ ci@@ ple of le@@ a@@ der@@ shi@@ p@@ , which is that you res@@ p@@ ect your te@@ am@@ , and you ear@@ n their res@@ p@@ ect in re@@ tur@@ n.
And it really chang@@ ed the d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic@@ .
So, here I was ag@@ a@@ in with a sm@@ all te@@ am@@ , in un@@ ch@@ ar@@ ted ter@@ rit@@ or@@ y, doing "@@ A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ ," com@@ ing up with new technolog@@ y that didn't ex@@ ist befor@@ e.
T@@ re@@ m@@ end@@ ous@@ ly ex@@ c@@ it@@ ing.
T@@ re@@ m@@ end@@ ous@@ ly ch@@ all@@ eng@@ ing.
And we bec@@ ame a fam@@ il@@ y, over a f@@ our@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ hal@@ f ye@@ ar per@@ i@@ o@@ d.
And it compl@@ et@@ ely chang@@ ed how I do mo@@ vi@@ es.
So, people have comm@@ ent@@ ed on ho@@ w, "@@ Well, you know, you br@@ ou@@ ght back the oc@@ e@@ an organ@@ is@@ m@@ s and put them on the plan@@ et of P@@ and@@ or@@ a@@ ."
T@@ o me, it was more of a f@@ und@@ am@@ ent@@ al way of doing b@@ us@@ in@@ es@@ s, the pro@@ c@@ ess it@@ self@@ , that chang@@ ed as a res@@ ul@@ t of that.
So, what can we sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ iz@@ e out of all th@@ is@@ ?
You know, what are the l@@ ess@@ ons lear@@ ne@@ d@@ ?
Well, I think num@@ ber one is c@@ u@@ ri@@ o@@ sit@@ y.
It's the most po@@ wer@@ ful thing you o@@ w@@ n.
I@@ mag@@ in@@ ation is a for@@ ce that can actually man@@ if@@ est a real@@ ity.
And the res@@ p@@ ect of your te@@ am is more import@@ ant than all the l@@ au@@ rel@@ s in the world.
I have y@@ o@@ ung f@@ il@@ m@@ ma@@ k@@ ers come up to me and say, "@@ G@@ i@@ ve me some ad@@ vi@@ ce for doing th@@ is@@ ."
And I say, "@@ D@@ on@@ 't put li@@ mit@@ ations on you@@ r@@ self@@ .
O@@ ther people will do that for you -- don't do it to you@@ r@@ self@@ , don't be@@ t again@@ st you@@ r@@ self@@ , and take ris@@ k@@ s@@ ."
N@@ A@@ S@@ A has this p@@ hr@@ ase that they lik@@ e: "@@ F@@ a@@ il@@ ure is not an op@@ tion@@ ."
But fa@@ il@@ ure has to be an op@@ tion in ar@@ t and in ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ation, because it's a le@@ a@@ p of fa@@ i@@ th@@ .
And no import@@ ant en@@ de@@ a@@ vor that re@@ qu@@ i@@ red in@@ no@@ v@@ ation was d@@ one with@@ out ris@@ k.
You have to be wi@@ ll@@ ing to take those ris@@ k@@ s.
So, that's the thought I would le@@ a@@ ve you with@@ , is that in wh@@ at@@ ever you're do@@ ing, fa@@ il@@ ure is an op@@ tion, but fe@@ ar is no@@ t. Thank you.
If I can le@@ a@@ ve you with one big idea to@@ da@@ y, it's that the whole of the dat@@ a in which we con@@ sum@@ e is gre@@ at@@ er that the s@@ um of the par@@ t@@ s, and in@@ ste@@ ad of thin@@ king about in@@ form@@ ation o@@ ver@@ lo@@ a@@ d, what I'@@ d like you to think about is how we can use in@@ form@@ ation so that p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ s po@@ p and we can see tr@@ en@@ ds that would other@@ wis@@ e be inv@@ is@@ i@@ bl@@ e.
So what we're looking at right here is a ty@@ pic@@ al mor@@ tal@@ ity ch@@ ar@@ t organ@@ iz@@ ed by ag@@ e.
This to@@ o@@ l that I'm us@@ ing here is a little exper@@ im@@ ent.
It's called P@@ i@@ v@@ o@@ t, and with P@@ i@@ v@@ o@@ t what I can do is I can ch@@ oo@@ se to f@@ il@@ ter in one par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar c@@ ause of de@@ a@@ th@@ s -- say, ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ s.
An@@ d, right a@@ way, I see there's a different p@@ at@@ tern that em@@ er@@ ges@@ .
This is bec@@ aus@@ e, in the m@@ id@@ -@@ ar@@ e@@ a here, people are at their most ac@@ tiv@@ e, and over here they're at their most f@@ ra@@ il@@ .
We can ste@@ p back out ag@@ a@@ in and then re@@ organ@@ iz@@ e the dat@@ a by c@@ ause of de@@ a@@ th@@ , se@@ ein@@ g that c@@ ir@@ cul@@ at@@ or@@ y dis@@ eas@@ es and can@@ c@@ er are the us@@ u@@ al s@@ us@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ s, but not for every@@ on@@ e.
If we go ah@@ e@@ ad and we f@@ il@@ ter by age -- say 4@@ 0 years or l@@ ess -- we see that ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents are actually the gre@@ at@@ est c@@ ause that people have to be wor@@ ri@@ ed ab@@ ou@@ t.
And if you dri@@ ll into that, it's es@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ ally the c@@ ase for m@@ en.
So you get the idea that vie@@ wing in@@ form@@ ation, vie@@ wing dat@@ a in this way, is a lot like s@@ wi@@ mm@@ ing in a li@@ ving in@@ form@@ ation in@@ f@@ o@@ -@@ gra@@ ph@@ ic@@ .
And if we can do this for ra@@ w dat@@ a, why not do it for con@@ t@@ ent as w@@ ell@@ ?
So what we have right here is the co@@ ver of every s@@ ing@@ le Sp@@ or@@ ts I@@ ll@@ u@@ str@@ ated ever produc@@ ed.
It's all her@@ e@@ ; it's all on the we@@ b@@ .
You can go back to your ro@@ om@@ s and try this after my tal@@ k.
W@@ it@@ h P@@ i@@ v@@ o@@ t, you can dri@@ ll into a de@@ c@@ ad@@ e.
You can dri@@ ll into a par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar year@@ .
You can j@@ um@@ p right into a spec@@ if@@ ic is@@ su@@ e.
So I'm looking at th@@ is@@ ; I see the a@@ th@@ l@@ et@@ es that have ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed in this is@@ su@@ e, the sp@@ ort@@ s.
I'm a L@@ ance Ar@@ m@@ str@@ ong f@@ an, so I'@@ ll go ah@@ e@@ ad and I'@@ ll c@@ li@@ ck on that, which re@@ v@@ e@@ al@@ s, for me, all the is@@ su@@ es in which L@@ ance Ar@@ m@@ str@@ ong@@ 's been a part of@@ .
Now, if I want to just kind of take a pe@@ e@@ k at th@@ es@@ e, I might thin@@ k, "@@ Well, what about ta@@ king a look at all of c@@ y@@ c@@ l@@ ing@@ ?"
So I can ste@@ p bac@@ k, and exp@@ and on that.
And I see G@@ re@@ g Le@@ Mon@@ d no@@ w.
And so you get the idea that when you n@@ av@@ ig@@ ate over in@@ form@@ ation this way -- going n@@ ar@@ ro@@ wer@@ , b@@ ro@@ a@@ der@@ , bac@@ king in, bac@@ king out -- you're not se@@ ar@@ ch@@ ing, you're not b@@ ro@@ w@@ s@@ ing.
Y@@ ou@@ 're doing something that's actually a little bit differ@@ ent.
It's in bet@@ we@@ en, and we think it chang@@ es the way in@@ form@@ ation can be us@@ ed.
So I want to ex@@ tra@@ p@@ ol@@ ate on this idea a bit with something that's a little bit c@@ ra@@ z@@ y.
What we're d@@ one here is we've ta@@ ken every s@@ ing@@ le W@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ di@@ a p@@ age and we re@@ duc@@ ed it down to a little sum@@ mar@@ y.
So the sum@@ mar@@ y con@@ si@@ st@@ s of just a little sy@@ no@@ p@@ s@@ is and an ic@@ on to in@@ dic@@ ate the to@@ pic@@ al ar@@ e@@ a that it comes fro@@ m.
I'm only sho@@ wing the to@@ p 5@@ 00 most po@@ pul@@ ar W@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ di@@ a p@@ ag@@ es right here.
But even in this li@@ mit@@ ed vie@@ w, we can do a lot of thing@@ s.
R@@ ight a@@ way, we get a sen@@ se of what are the to@@ pic@@ al d@@ om@@ ain@@ s that are most po@@ pul@@ ar on W@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ di@@ a.
I'm going to go ah@@ e@@ ad and sel@@ ect go@@ ver@@ n@@ men@@ t.
Now, ha@@ ving sel@@ ec@@ ted go@@ ver@@ n@@ men@@ t, I can now see that the W@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ di@@ a c@@ at@@ eg@@ or@@ ies that most fre@@ qu@@ ent@@ ly cor@@ res@@ p@@ on@@ d to that are T@@ im@@ e mag@@ az@@ ine P@@ e@@ o@@ ple of the Y@@ ear@@ .
So this is really import@@ ant because this is an in@@ s@@ ight that was not con@@ ta@@ in@@ ed with@@ in any one W@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ di@@ a p@@ ag@@ e.
It's only possi@@ ble to see that in@@ s@@ ight when you ste@@ p back and look at all of them.
L@@ oo@@ king at one of these par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar sum@@ mar@@ i@@ es, I can then dri@@ ll into the con@@ c@@ ep@@ t of T@@ im@@ e mag@@ az@@ ine Per@@ son of the Y@@ ear@@ , bring@@ ing up all of them.
So looking at these peopl@@ e, I can see that the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity come from go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment@@ ; some have come from nat@@ ur@@ al sci@@ enc@@ es@@ ; som@@ e, fe@@ wer st@@ ill@@ , have come from b@@ us@@ in@@ ess -- there's my bo@@ s@@ s -- and one has come from mus@@ ic@@ .
And inter@@ est@@ ing@@ ly en@@ ou@@ gh@@ , B@@ on@@ o is also a TED P@@ ri@@ ze w@@ inn@@ er.
So we can go@@ , j@@ um@@ p@@ , and take a look at all the TED P@@ ri@@ ze w@@ inn@@ er@@ s.
So you se@@ e, we're n@@ av@@ ig@@ ating the we@@ b for the first time as if it's actually a we@@ b@@ , not from p@@ ag@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ p@@ ag@@ e, but at a h@@ igh@@ er le@@ v@@ el of ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tion.
And so I want to show you one other thing that ma@@ y c@@ at@@ ch you a little bit by sur@@ pr@@ is@@ e.
I'm just sho@@ wing the New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es we@@ b@@ s@@ ite here.
So P@@ i@@ v@@ o@@ t, this a@@ pp@@ lic@@ ation -- I don't want to c@@ all it a b@@ ro@@ w@@ ser@@ ; it's really not a b@@ ro@@ w@@ ser@@ , but you can vie@@ w we@@ b p@@ ag@@ es with it -- and we br@@ ing that z@@ o@@ om@@ able technolog@@ y to every s@@ ing@@ le we@@ b p@@ age like this.
So I can ste@@ p bac@@ k, po@@ p right back into a spec@@ if@@ ic s@@ ec@@ tion.
Now the reas@@ on why this is import@@ ant is bec@@ aus@@ e, by vir@@ tu@@ e of just vie@@ wing we@@ b p@@ ag@@ es in this way, I can look at my enti@@ re b@@ ro@@ w@@ s@@ ing h@@ ist@@ or@@ y in the ex@@ ac@@ t same wa@@ y.
So I can dri@@ ll into what I've d@@ one over spec@@ if@@ ic time fr@@ am@@ es.
Her@@ e, in fac@@ t, is the st@@ ate of all the de@@ m@@ o that I just ga@@ ve.
And I can sort of re@@ pla@@ y some stu@@ f@@ f that I was looking at ear@@ li@@ er to@@ da@@ y.
An@@ d, if I want to ste@@ p back and look at every@@ thing@@ , I can s@@ li@@ ce and di@@ ce my h@@ ist@@ or@@ y, per@@ ha@@ ps by my se@@ ar@@ ch h@@ ist@@ or@@ y -- here, I was doing some ne@@ po@@ ti@@ st@@ ic se@@ ar@@ ch@@ ing, looking for B@@ ing, over here for Li@@ ve L@@ ab@@ s P@@ i@@ v@@ o@@ t.
And from th@@ es@@ e, I can dri@@ ll into the we@@ b p@@ age and just la@@ un@@ ch them again@@ .
It's one m@@ et@@ ap@@ h@@ or re@@ p@@ ur@@ pos@@ ed m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ple tim@@ es, and in each c@@ ase it ma@@ kes the whole gre@@ at@@ er than the s@@ um of the par@@ ts with the dat@@ a.
So right no@@ w, in this worl@@ d, we think about dat@@ a as being this c@@ ur@@ se.
We talk about the c@@ ur@@ se of in@@ form@@ ation o@@ ver@@ lo@@ a@@ d.
We talk about dro@@ w@@ ning in dat@@ a.
What if we can actually tur@@ n that up@@ side down and tur@@ n the we@@ b up@@ side do@@ w@@ n, so that in@@ ste@@ ad of n@@ av@@ ig@@ ating from one thing to the nex@@ t, we get used to the hab@@ it of being able to go from many things to many thing@@ s, and then being able to see the p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ s that were other@@ wis@@ e hi@@ d@@ den@@ ?
If we can do that, then in@@ ste@@ ad of being tra@@ pp@@ ed in dat@@ a, we might actually ex@@ tr@@ ac@@ t in@@ form@@ ation.
An@@ d, in@@ ste@@ ad of de@@ al@@ ing just with in@@ form@@ ation, we can te@@ ase out kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ e.
And if we get the kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ e, then ma@@ y@@ be even there's wis@@ do@@ m to be f@@ oun@@ d.
So with that, I th@@ ank you.
E@@ ver@@ y@@ body tal@@ ks about happ@@ in@@ ess these da@@ y@@ s.
I had som@@ eb@@ o@@ dy coun@@ t the num@@ ber of bo@@ o@@ ks with "@@ happ@@ in@@ ess@@ " in the tit@@ le p@@ ub@@ li@@ sh@@ ed in the last fi@@ ve years and they ga@@ ve up after about 4@@ 0@@ , and there were many mor@@ e.
There is a h@@ u@@ ge wa@@ ve of inter@@ est in happ@@ in@@ es@@ s, am@@ ong res@@ ear@@ ch@@ er@@ s.
There is a lot of happ@@ in@@ ess co@@ ach@@ ing.
E@@ ver@@ y@@ body would like to make people happ@@ ier@@ .
But in sp@@ ite of all this f@@ loo@@ d of wor@@ k, there are se@@ ver@@ al co@@ g@@ n@@ iti@@ ve tra@@ ps that sort of make it al@@ most im@@ possi@@ ble to think st@@ ra@@ ight about happ@@ in@@ es@@ s.
And my talk to@@ day will be mo@@ st@@ ly about these co@@ g@@ n@@ iti@@ ve tra@@ p@@ s.
This a@@ pp@@ li@@ es to la@@ y@@ people thin@@ king about their own happ@@ in@@ es@@ s, and it a@@ pp@@ li@@ es to sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ s thin@@ king about happ@@ in@@ es@@ s, because it tur@@ n@@ s out we're just as m@@ ess@@ ed up as any@@ body el@@ se is.
The first of these tra@@ ps is a rel@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ ance to ad@@ mit compl@@ ex@@ ity.
It tur@@ n@@ s out that the wor@@ d "@@ happ@@ in@@ ess@@ " is just not a us@@ e@@ ful wor@@ d any@@ mor@@ e, because we ap@@ pl@@ y it to to@@ o many different thing@@ s.
I think there is one par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar me@@ an@@ ing to which we might res@@ tri@@ c@@ t it, but by and lar@@ g@@ e, this is something that we@@ 'll have to give up and we@@ 'll have to a@@ do@@ p@@ t the more comp@@ lic@@ ated vie@@ w of what w@@ ell@@ -@@ being is.
The secon@@ d tra@@ p is a con@@ f@@ us@@ ion between exper@@ i@@ ence and mem@@ or@@ y@@ ; bas@@ ic@@ ally, it's between being happ@@ y in your lif@@ e, and being happ@@ y about your life or happ@@ y with your lif@@ e.
And those are two very different con@@ c@@ ep@@ t@@ s, and they're bo@@ th l@@ um@@ p@@ ed in the no@@ tion of happ@@ in@@ es@@ s.
And the th@@ ir@@ d is the f@@ oc@@ us@@ ing ill@@ us@@ i@@ on, and it's the un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate fac@@ t that we can't think about any c@@ ir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ ance that aff@@ ec@@ ts w@@ ell@@ -@@ being with@@ out di@@ stor@@ ting its import@@ anc@@ e.
I me@@ an, this is a real co@@ g@@ n@@ iti@@ ve tra@@ p@@ .
Ther@@ e's just no way of get@@ ting it righ@@ t.
Now, I'@@ d like to start with an exam@@ ple of som@@ eb@@ o@@ dy who had a ques@@ tion@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ ans@@ wer s@@ es@@ sion after one of my le@@ c@@ tur@@ es re@@ p@@ or@@ ted a stor@@ y, and that was a stor@@ y -- He said he@@ '@@ d been li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to a sy@@ m@@ ph@@ on@@ y, and it was ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely gl@@ ori@@ ous mus@@ ic and at the very end of the rec@@ ord@@ ing, there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful s@@ cre@@ e@@ ch@@ ing so@@ un@@ d.
And then he ad@@ de@@ d, really qu@@ ite em@@ o@@ tion@@ ally, it ru@@ in@@ ed the whole exper@@ i@@ enc@@ e.
But it ha@@ d@@ n@@ '@@ t.
What it had ru@@ in@@ ed were the mem@@ or@@ ies of the exper@@ i@@ enc@@ e.
He had had the exper@@ i@@ enc@@ e.
He had had 20 min@@ ut@@ es of gl@@ ori@@ ous mus@@ ic@@ .
They coun@@ ted for no@@ thing because he was le@@ ft with a mem@@ or@@ y@@ ; the mem@@ or@@ y was ru@@ in@@ ed, and the mem@@ or@@ y was all that he had go@@ t@@ ten to ke@@ ep@@ .
What this is tell@@ ing us@@ , re@@ ally, is that we might be thin@@ king of our@@ sel@@ ves and of other people in ter@@ m@@ s of two sel@@ v@@ es.
There is an exper@@ i@@ enc@@ ing self@@ , who li@@ ves in the pres@@ ent and kno@@ ws the pres@@ ent, is cap@@ able of re@@ -@@ li@@ ving the pa@@ st, but bas@@ ic@@ ally it has only the pres@@ ent.
It's the exper@@ i@@ enc@@ ing sel@@ f that the do@@ c@@ t@@ or ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es -- you know, when the do@@ c@@ t@@ or as@@ k@@ s, "@@ D@@ o@@ es it h@@ ur@@ t now when I t@@ ou@@ ch you her@@ e@@ ?"
And then there is a re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self@@ , and the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f is the one that ke@@ ep@@ s sc@@ or@@ e, and ma@@ in@@ ta@@ ins the stor@@ y of our lif@@ e, and it's the one that the do@@ c@@ t@@ or ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es in as@@ king the ques@@ tion, "@@ How have you been fe@@ el@@ ing lat@@ el@@ y@@ ?"
or "@@ How was your tri@@ p to Al@@ b@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ ?" or something like that.
Th@@ o@@ se are two very different ent@@ iti@@ es, the exper@@ i@@ enc@@ ing sel@@ f and the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self@@ , and get@@ ting con@@ f@@ used between them is part of the m@@ ess about the no@@ tion of happ@@ in@@ es@@ s.
Now, the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f is a stor@@ y@@ tell@@ er.
And that really star@@ ts with a bas@@ ic res@@ p@@ on@@ se of our mem@@ or@@ ies -- it star@@ ts im@@ me@@ di@@ at@@ el@@ y.
We don't only tell stor@@ ies when we se@@ t out to tell stor@@ i@@ es.
O@@ ur mem@@ or@@ y tell@@ s us stor@@ i@@ es, that is, what we get to ke@@ ep from our exper@@ i@@ enc@@ es is a stor@@ y.
And le@@ t me beg@@ in with one exam@@ pl@@ e.
This is an old stu@@ d@@ y.
Th@@ o@@ se are actu@@ al p@@ ati@@ ents under@@ going a pa@@ in@@ ful pro@@ c@@ e@@ du@@ re.
I w@@ on@@ 't go into d@@ et@@ a@@ il@@ . It's no l@@ on@@ ger pa@@ in@@ ful these da@@ y@@ s, but it was pa@@ in@@ ful when this stu@@ dy was ru@@ n in the 19@@ 9@@ 0@@ s.
They were as@@ ked to re@@ p@@ ort on their pa@@ in every 6@@ 0 secon@@ d@@ s.
H@@ ere are two p@@ ati@@ ent@@ s, those are their rec@@ ord@@ ing@@ s.
And you are as@@ k@@ ed, "@@ Wh@@ o of them su@@ ffer@@ ed mor@@ e@@ ?"
And it's a very eas@@ y ques@@ tion.
C@@ lear@@ ly, P@@ ati@@ ent B su@@ ffer@@ ed more -- his col@@ on@@ o@@ s@@ co@@ p@@ y was l@@ ong@@ er, and every min@@ u@@ te of pa@@ in that P@@ ati@@ ent A ha@@ d, P@@ ati@@ ent B ha@@ d, and mor@@ e.
But now there is another ques@@ tion@@ : "@@ How much did these p@@ ati@@ ents think they su@@ ffer@@ ed@@ ?"
And here is a sur@@ pr@@ is@@ e.
The sur@@ pr@@ is@@ e is that P@@ ati@@ ent A had a much wor@@ se mem@@ or@@ y of the col@@ on@@ o@@ s@@ co@@ p@@ y than P@@ ati@@ ent B@@ .
The stor@@ ies of the col@@ on@@ o@@ s@@ co@@ p@@ ies were differ@@ ent, and because a very c@@ rit@@ ical part of the stor@@ y is how it end@@ s.
And n@@ ei@@ ther of these stor@@ ies is very in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing or great -- but one of them is this di@@ st@@ in@@ c@@ t ... but one of them is di@@ st@@ in@@ c@@ t@@ ly wor@@ se than the other@@ .
And the one that is wor@@ se is the one where pa@@ in was at its pe@@ a@@ k at the very end@@ ; it's a b@@ ad stor@@ y.
How do we know that@@ ?
Because we as@@ ked these people after their col@@ on@@ o@@ s@@ co@@ p@@ y, and much lat@@ er, to@@ o, "@@ How b@@ ad was the whole thing@@ , in to@@ tal@@ ?"
And it was much wor@@ se for A than for B@@ , in mem@@ or@@ y.
Now this is a di@@ rec@@ t con@@ f@@ lic@@ t between the exper@@ i@@ enc@@ ing sel@@ f and the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self@@ .
F@@ ro@@ m the poin@@ t of vie@@ w of the exper@@ i@@ enc@@ ing self@@ , c@@ lear@@ ly, B had a wor@@ se time.
Now, what you could do with P@@ ati@@ ent A@@ , and we actually r@@ an c@@ lin@@ ical exper@@ im@@ ent@@ s, and it has been don@@ e, and it does work -- you could actually ex@@ ten@@ d the col@@ on@@ o@@ s@@ co@@ p@@ y of P@@ ati@@ ent A by just ke@@ ep@@ ing the tu@@ be in with@@ out j@@ ig@@ gl@@ ing it to@@ o mu@@ ch.
That will c@@ ause the p@@ ati@@ ent to su@@ ff@@ er, but just a little and much l@@ ess than befor@@ e.
And if you do that for a c@@ ou@@ ple of min@@ ut@@ es, you have made the exper@@ i@@ enc@@ ing sel@@ f of P@@ ati@@ ent A wor@@ se off@@ , and you have the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f of P@@ ati@@ ent A a lot bet@@ ter off@@ , because now you have en@@ do@@ w@@ ed P@@ ati@@ ent A with a bet@@ ter stor@@ y about his exper@@ i@@ enc@@ e.
What de@@ fin@@ es a stor@@ y@@ ?
And that is tru@@ e of the stor@@ ies that mem@@ or@@ y del@@ i@@ ver@@ s for us@@ , and it's also tru@@ e of the stor@@ ies that we make up@@ .
What de@@ fin@@ es a stor@@ y are ch@@ an@@ ges@@ , s@@ ign@@ if@@ ic@@ ant m@@ om@@ ents and end@@ ing@@ s.
En@@ d@@ ing@@ s are ver@@ y, very import@@ ant and, in this c@@ as@@ e, the end@@ ing d@@ om@@ in@@ at@@ ed.
Now, the exper@@ i@@ enc@@ ing sel@@ f li@@ ves its life con@@ tin@@ u@@ ous@@ l@@ y.
It has m@@ om@@ ents of exper@@ i@@ enc@@ e, one after the other@@ .
And you can as@@ k@@ : What happ@@ ens to these m@@ om@@ ent@@ s@@ ?
And the ans@@ wer is really st@@ ra@@ igh@@ t@@ for@@ war@@ d@@ : They are lo@@ st for@@ ever@@ .
I me@@ an, most of the m@@ om@@ ents of our life -- and I c@@ al@@ cul@@ at@@ ed, you know, the p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ical pres@@ ent is said to be about three secon@@ ds l@@ ong@@ ; that me@@ ans that, you know, in a life there are about 6@@ 00 million of them@@ ; in a mon@@ th@@ , there are about 6@@ 00@@ ,000 -- most of them don't le@@ a@@ ve a tr@@ ac@@ e.
Mo@@ st of them are compl@@ et@@ ely ign@@ or@@ ed by the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self@@ .
And y@@ et, som@@ eh@@ o@@ w you get the sen@@ se that they should coun@@ t, that what happ@@ ens dur@@ ing these m@@ om@@ ents of exper@@ i@@ ence is our lif@@ e.
It's the fin@@ ite res@@ our@@ ce that we're sp@@ end@@ ing wh@@ ile we're on this ear@@ th@@ .
And how to sp@@ end it would se@@ em to be rel@@ ev@@ an@@ t, but that is not the stor@@ y that the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f ke@@ ep@@ s for us@@ .
So we have the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f and the exper@@ i@@ enc@@ ing self@@ , and they're really qu@@ ite di@@ st@@ in@@ c@@ t.
The b@@ ig@@ ges@@ t differ@@ ence between them is in the h@@ and@@ l@@ ing of time.
F@@ ro@@ m the poin@@ t of vie@@ w of the exper@@ i@@ enc@@ ing self@@ , if you have a v@@ ac@@ ation, and the secon@@ d we@@ e@@ k is just as good as the fir@@ st, then the t@@ w@@ o@@ -@@ we@@ e@@ k v@@ ac@@ ation is t@@ wi@@ ce as good as the on@@ e-@@ we@@ e@@ k v@@ ac@@ ation.
That's not the way it wor@@ ks at all for the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self@@ .
F@@ or the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self@@ , a t@@ w@@ o@@ -@@ we@@ e@@ k v@@ ac@@ ation is bar@@ ely bet@@ ter than the on@@ e-@@ we@@ e@@ k v@@ ac@@ ation because there are no new mem@@ or@@ ies ad@@ de@@ d.
You have not chang@@ ed the stor@@ y.
And in this way, time is actually the c@@ rit@@ ical v@@ ari@@ able that di@@ st@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ h@@ es a re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f from an exper@@ i@@ enc@@ ing self@@ ; time has very little imp@@ ac@@ t on the stor@@ y.
Now, the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f does more than re@@ mem@@ ber and tell stor@@ i@@ es.
It is actually the one that ma@@ kes de@@ c@@ is@@ i@@ ons bec@@ aus@@ e, if you have a p@@ ati@@ ent who has ha@@ d, say, two col@@ on@@ o@@ s@@ co@@ p@@ ies with two different sur@@ ge@@ ons and is de@@ ci@@ ding which of them to ch@@ oo@@ se, then the one that ch@@ oo@@ s@@ es is the one that has the mem@@ or@@ y that is l@@ ess b@@ a@@ d, and that's the sur@@ ge@@ on that will be ch@@ o@@ s@@ en.
The exper@@ i@@ enc@@ ing sel@@ f has no v@@ o@@ ice in this ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e.
We actually don't ch@@ oo@@ se between exper@@ i@@ enc@@ es, we ch@@ oo@@ se between mem@@ or@@ ies of exper@@ i@@ enc@@ es.
And even when we think about the f@@ ut@@ u@@ re, we don't think of our f@@ ut@@ ure nor@@ m@@ ally as exper@@ i@@ enc@@ es.
We think of our f@@ ut@@ ure as an@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated mem@@ ori@@ es.
And bas@@ ic@@ ally you can look at this, you know, as a ty@@ r@@ ann@@ y of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self@@ , and you can think of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f sort of dr@@ ag@@ g@@ ing the exper@@ i@@ enc@@ ing sel@@ f through exper@@ i@@ enc@@ es that the exper@@ i@@ enc@@ ing sel@@ f doesn't ne@@ ed.
I have that sen@@ se that when we go on v@@ ac@@ ations this is very fre@@ qu@@ ent@@ ly the c@@ as@@ e@@ ; that is, we go on v@@ ac@@ ation@@ s, to a very lar@@ ge ex@@ ten@@ t, in the ser@@ vi@@ ce of our re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self@@ .
And this is a bit har@@ d to j@@ u@@ st@@ if@@ y I thin@@ k.
I me@@ an, how much do we con@@ sum@@ e our mem@@ ori@@ es@@ ?
That is one of the ex@@ plan@@ ations that is gi@@ ven for the d@@ om@@ in@@ ance of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self@@ .
And when I think about that, I think about a v@@ ac@@ ation we had in An@@ t@@ ar@@ c@@ tic@@ a a few years ag@@ o, which was c@@ lear@@ ly the bes@@ t v@@ ac@@ ation I've ever ha@@ d, and I think of it rel@@ ati@@ v@@ ely of@@ ten, rel@@ ative to how much I think of other v@@ ac@@ ation@@ s.
And I pro@@ bab@@ ly have con@@ sum@@ ed my mem@@ or@@ ies of that thre@@ e-@@ we@@ e@@ k tri@@ p@@ , I would say, for about 2@@ 5 min@@ ut@@ es in the last f@@ our year@@ s.
Now, if I had ever op@@ en@@ ed the fol@@ der with the 6@@ 00 pic@@ tur@@ es in it, I would have sp@@ ent another h@@ our@@ .
Now, that is three we@@ ek@@ s, and that is at most an h@@ our and a hal@@ f@@ .
There se@@ em@@ s to be a dis@@ cre@@ p@@ anc@@ y.
Now, I ma@@ y be a bit ex@@ tre@@ me, you know, in how little a@@ pp@@ et@@ ite I have for con@@ sum@@ ing mem@@ ori@@ es, but even if you do more of this, there is a gen@@ u@@ ine ques@@ tion@@ : Wh@@ y do we put so much wei@@ ght on mem@@ or@@ y rel@@ ative to the wei@@ ght that we put on exper@@ i@@ enc@@ es@@ ?
So I want you to think about a thought exper@@ im@@ ent.
I@@ mag@@ ine that for your next v@@ ac@@ ation, you know that at the end of the v@@ ac@@ ation all your pic@@ tur@@ es will be des@@ tro@@ y@@ ed, and you@@ 'll get an am@@ n@@ es@@ ic d@@ ru@@ g so that you w@@ on@@ 't re@@ mem@@ ber any@@ thing@@ .
Now, would you ch@@ oo@@ se the same v@@ ac@@ ation@@ ? And if you would ch@@ oo@@ se a different v@@ ac@@ ation, there is a con@@ f@@ lic@@ t between your two sel@@ v@@ es, and you need to think about how to ad@@ j@@ u@@ dic@@ ate that con@@ f@@ lic@@ t, and it's actually not at all ob@@ vi@@ ou@@ s, because if you think in ter@@ m@@ s of time, then you get one ans@@ wer@@ , and if you think in ter@@ m@@ s of mem@@ ori@@ es, you might get another ans@@ wer@@ .
Wh@@ y do we pic@@ k the v@@ ac@@ ations we do is a pro@@ blem that con@@ fr@@ on@@ ts us with a ch@@ o@@ ice between the two sel@@ v@@ es.
Now, the two sel@@ ves br@@ ing up two no@@ tions of happ@@ in@@ es@@ s.
There are really two con@@ c@@ ep@@ ts of happ@@ in@@ ess that we can ap@@ pl@@ y, one per self@@ .
So you can as@@ k@@ : How happ@@ y is the exper@@ i@@ enc@@ ing self@@ ?
And then you would as@@ k@@ : How happ@@ y are the m@@ om@@ ents in the exper@@ i@@ enc@@ ing self@@ 's li@@ fe@@ ?
And they're all -- happ@@ in@@ ess for m@@ om@@ ents is a fa@@ ir@@ ly comp@@ lic@@ ated pro@@ c@@ es@@ s.
What are the em@@ o@@ tions that can be me@@ as@@ u@@ re@@ d@@ ?
An@@ d, by the way, now we are cap@@ able of get@@ ting a pre@@ tt@@ y good idea of the happ@@ in@@ ess of the exper@@ i@@ enc@@ ing sel@@ f over time.
If you as@@ k for the happ@@ in@@ ess of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self@@ , it's a compl@@ et@@ ely different thing@@ .
This is not about how happ@@ il@@ y a per@@ son li@@ v@@ es.
It is about how s@@ at@@ is@@ fi@@ ed or pl@@ eas@@ ed the per@@ son is when that per@@ son thin@@ ks about her lif@@ e.
Ver@@ y different no@@ tion.
An@@ y@@ one who doesn't di@@ st@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ h those no@@ tions is going to m@@ ess up the stu@@ dy of happ@@ in@@ es@@ s, and I bel@@ ong to a c@@ ro@@ w@@ d of stu@@ d@@ ents of w@@ ell@@ -@@ bein@@ g@@ , wh@@ o@@ 've been m@@ ess@@ ing up the stu@@ dy of happ@@ in@@ ess for a long time in pre@@ c@@ is@@ ely this wa@@ y.
The di@@ st@@ in@@ c@@ tion between the happ@@ in@@ ess of the exper@@ i@@ enc@@ ing sel@@ f and the s@@ at@@ is@@ fac@@ tion of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f has been re@@ co@@ g@@ n@@ iz@@ ed in rec@@ ent year@@ s, and there are now eff@@ or@@ ts to me@@ as@@ ure the two se@@ par@@ at@@ el@@ y.
The G@@ all@@ up Or@@ gan@@ iz@@ ation has a world p@@ ol@@ l where more than hal@@ f a million people have been as@@ ked ques@@ tions about what they think of their life and about their exper@@ i@@ enc@@ es, and there have been other eff@@ or@@ ts al@@ ong those lin@@ es.
So in rec@@ ent year@@ s, we have be@@ gu@@ n to lear@@ n about the happ@@ in@@ ess of the two sel@@ v@@ es.
And the ma@@ in l@@ ess@@ on I think that we have lear@@ n@@ ed is they are really differ@@ ent.
You can know how s@@ at@@ is@@ fi@@ ed som@@ eb@@ o@@ dy is with their lif@@ e, and that really doesn't te@@ ach you much about how happ@@ il@@ y they're li@@ ving their lif@@ e, and vi@@ ce ver@@ sa@@ .
J@@ ust to give you a sen@@ se of the cor@@ rel@@ ation, the cor@@ rel@@ ation is about .@@ 5@@ .
What that me@@ ans is if you me@@ t som@@ eb@@ o@@ d@@ y, and you were t@@ ol@@ d, "@@ O@@ h his fa@@ ther is si@@ x fe@@ et t@@ all@@ ," how much would you know about his hei@@ gh@@ t?
Well, you would know something about his hei@@ gh@@ t, but there's a lot of un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ t@@ y.
You have that much un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ t@@ y.
If I tell you that som@@ eb@@ o@@ dy ran@@ ked their life ei@@ ght on a sc@@ ale of ten, you have a lot of un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty about how happ@@ y they are with their exper@@ i@@ enc@@ ing self@@ .
So the cor@@ rel@@ ation is lo@@ w.
We know something about what con@@ tro@@ l@@ s s@@ at@@ is@@ fac@@ tion of the happ@@ in@@ ess self@@ .
We know that mon@@ ey is very import@@ an@@ t, go@@ als are very import@@ an@@ t.
We know that happ@@ in@@ ess is ma@@ in@@ ly being s@@ at@@ is@@ fi@@ ed with people that we lik@@ e, sp@@ end@@ ing time with people that we lik@@ e.
There are other pl@@ eas@@ ur@@ es, but this is d@@ om@@ in@@ an@@ t.
So if you want to ma@@ x@@ im@@ iz@@ e the happ@@ in@@ ess of the two sel@@ v@@ es, you are going to end up doing very different thing@@ s.
The bo@@ t@@ to@@ m l@@ ine of what I've said here is that we really should not think of happ@@ in@@ ess as a sub@@ st@@ itu@@ te for w@@ ell@@ -@@ bein@@ g@@ .
It is a compl@@ et@@ ely different no@@ tion.
Now, very qu@@ ic@@ kl@@ y, another reas@@ on we can@@ not think st@@ ra@@ ight about happ@@ in@@ ess is that we do not at@@ ten@@ d to the same things when we think about lif@@ e, and we actually li@@ ve.
So, if you as@@ k the sim@@ ple ques@@ tion of how happ@@ y people are in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a, you are not going to get to the cor@@ rec@@ t ans@@ wer@@ .
When you as@@ k that ques@@ tion, you think people m@@ ust be happ@@ ier in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a if@@ , say, you li@@ ve in O@@ hi@@ o.
And what happ@@ ens is when you think about li@@ ving in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a, you are thin@@ king of the con@@ tr@@ ast between C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a and other plac@@ es, and that con@@ tra@@ st, say, is in c@@ li@@ mat@@ e.
Well, it tur@@ n@@ s out that c@@ lim@@ ate is not very import@@ ant to the exper@@ i@@ enc@@ ing sel@@ f and it's not even very import@@ ant to the re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ tive sel@@ f that de@@ ci@@ des how happ@@ y people ar@@ e.
But no@@ w, because the re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ tive sel@@ f is in ch@@ ar@@ g@@ e, you ma@@ y end up -- some people ma@@ y end up mo@@ ving to C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a.
And it's sort of interes@@ ting to tr@@ ac@@ e what is going to happ@@ en to people who mo@@ ve to C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a in the ho@@ pe of get@@ ting happ@@ ier@@ .
Well, their exper@@ i@@ enc@@ ing sel@@ f is not going to get happ@@ ier@@ .
We know that.
But one thing will happen@@ : They will think they are happ@@ ier@@ , bec@@ aus@@ e, when they think about it, they@@ 'll be re@@ min@@ ded of how h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble the we@@ a@@ ther was in O@@ hi@@ o, and they will fe@@ el they made the right de@@ c@@ is@@ i@@ on.
It is very di@@ ff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t to think st@@ ra@@ ight about w@@ ell@@ -@@ bein@@ g@@ , and I ho@@ pe I have gi@@ ven you a sen@@ se of how di@@ ff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t it is.
Thank you.
C@@ hr@@ is An@@ der@@ son@@ : Thank you. I've got a ques@@ tion for you.
Thank you so mu@@ ch.
Now, when we were on the ph@@ one a few we@@ ek@@ s ag@@ o, you men@@ tion@@ ed to me that there was qu@@ ite an interes@@ ting res@@ ul@@ t came out of that G@@ all@@ up sur@@ v@@ e@@ y.
I@@ s that something you can sh@@ are sin@@ ce you do have a few m@@ om@@ ents le@@ ft no@@ w@@ ?
D@@ an@@ ie@@ l K@@ ah@@ n@@ em@@ an@@ : Su@@ re.
I think the most interes@@ ting res@@ ul@@ t that we found in the G@@ all@@ up sur@@ v@@ ey is a num@@ ber@@ , which we ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely did not exp@@ ect to fin@@ d.
We found that with res@@ p@@ ect to the happ@@ in@@ ess of the exper@@ i@@ enc@@ ing self@@ .
When we loo@@ ked at how fe@@ el@@ ing@@ s, v@@ ary with in@@ com@@ e.
And it tur@@ n@@ s out that, bel@@ o@@ w an in@@ come of 6@@ 0@@ ,000 d@@ ollar@@ s a year@@ , for Americ@@ ans -- and that's a very lar@@ ge sam@@ ple of Americ@@ an@@ s, like 6@@ 00@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ , so it's a lar@@ ge re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative sam@@ ple -- bel@@ o@@ w an in@@ come of 6@@ 00@@ ,000 d@@ ollar@@ s a year@@ ...
C@@ A@@ : 6@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ .
D@@ K@@ : 6@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ .
6@@ 0@@ ,000 d@@ ollar@@ s a year@@ , people are un@@ happ@@ y, and they get pro@@ gr@@ es@@ si@@ v@@ ely un@@ happ@@ ier the po@@ or@@ er they get@@ .
A@@ bo@@ ve that, we get an ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely fl@@ at lin@@ e.
I me@@ an I've r@@ ar@@ ely se@@ en lin@@ es so fl@@ at@@ .
C@@ lear@@ ly, what is happen@@ ing is mon@@ ey does not bu@@ y you exper@@ i@@ enti@@ al happ@@ in@@ es@@ s, but l@@ ack of mon@@ ey cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly bu@@ ys you mis@@ er@@ y, and we can me@@ as@@ ure that mis@@ er@@ y ver@@ y, very c@@ lear@@ l@@ y.
In ter@@ m@@ s of the other self@@ , the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self@@ , you get a different stor@@ y.
The more mon@@ ey you ear@@ n, the more s@@ at@@ is@@ fi@@ ed you ar@@ e.
That does not h@@ old for em@@ o@@ tion@@ s.
C@@ A@@ : But D@@ ann@@ y, the whole Americ@@ an en@@ de@@ a@@ vor is about lif@@ e, li@@ ber@@ t@@ y, the p@@ ur@@ su@@ it of happ@@ in@@ es@@ s.
If people to@@ ok ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ly that fin@@ d@@ ing, I me@@ an, it se@@ em@@ s to tur@@ n up@@ side down every@@ thing we belie@@ ve ab@@ ou@@ t, like for exam@@ pl@@ e, ta@@ x@@ ation po@@ lic@@ y and so for@@ th@@ .
I@@ s there any ch@@ ance that poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ an@@ s, that the coun@@ try gener@@ ally, would take a fin@@ ding like that ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ly and ru@@ n p@@ ub@@ li@@ c po@@ lic@@ y bas@@ ed on it@@ ?
D@@ K@@ : You know I think that there is re@@ co@@ g@@ n@@ iti@@ on of the ro@@ le of happ@@ in@@ ess res@@ ear@@ ch in p@@ ub@@ li@@ c po@@ lic@@ y.
The re@@ co@@ g@@ n@@ iti@@ on is going to be s@@ lo@@ w in the Un@@ ited St@@ at@@ es, no ques@@ tion about that, but in the U@@ .@@ K@@ .@@ , it is happen@@ ing, and in other coun@@ tri@@ es it is happen@@ ing.
P@@ e@@ o@@ ple are re@@ co@@ g@@ n@@ iz@@ ing that they ou@@ ght to be thin@@ king of happ@@ in@@ ess when they think of p@@ ub@@ li@@ c po@@ lic@@ y.
It's going to take a wh@@ il@@ e, and people are going to de@@ b@@ ate wh@@ e@@ ther they want to stu@@ dy exper@@ i@@ ence happ@@ in@@ es@@ s, or wh@@ e@@ ther they want to stu@@ dy life ev@@ al@@ u@@ ation, so we need to have that de@@ b@@ ate fa@@ ir@@ ly so@@ on.
How to en@@ h@@ ance happ@@ in@@ ess go@@ es very different ways de@@ p@@ end@@ ing on how you thin@@ k, and wh@@ e@@ ther you think of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f or you think of the exper@@ i@@ enc@@ ing self@@ .
This is going to in@@ fl@@ u@@ ence po@@ lic@@ y, I thin@@ k, in years to com@@ e.
In the Un@@ ited St@@ at@@ es, eff@@ or@@ ts are being made to me@@ as@@ ure the exper@@ i@@ ence happ@@ in@@ ess of the po@@ pul@@ ation.
This is going to b@@ e, I thin@@ k, with@@ in the next de@@ c@@ ade or t@@ w@@ o, part of n@@ ational st@@ ati@@ st@@ ic@@ s.
C@@ A@@ : Well, it se@@ em@@ s to me that this is@@ su@@ e will -- or at le@@ ast should be -- the most interes@@ ting po@@ lic@@ y dis@@ c@@ us@@ sion to tr@@ ack over the next few year@@ s.
Thank you so much for inv@@ ent@@ ing beh@@ a@@ vi@@ or@@ al econ@@ om@@ ic@@ s.
Thank you@@ , D@@ ann@@ y K@@ ah@@ n@@ em@@ an.
I'm going to talk to@@ day about energ@@ y and c@@ li@@ mat@@ e.
And that might se@@ em a bit sur@@ pr@@ is@@ ing because my ful@@ l@@ -@@ time work at the Fo@@ und@@ ation is mo@@ st@@ ly about v@@ acc@@ in@@ es and se@@ ed@@ s, about the things that we need to inv@@ ent and del@@ i@@ ver to hel@@ p the po@@ or@@ est two b@@ illion li@@ ve bet@@ ter li@@ v@@ es.
But energ@@ y and c@@ lim@@ ate are ex@@ tre@@ m@@ ely import@@ ant to these people -- in fac@@ t, more import@@ ant than to any@@ one el@@ se on the plan@@ et.
The c@@ lim@@ ate get@@ ting wor@@ se me@@ ans that many year@@ s, their c@@ ro@@ ps w@@ on@@ 't gro@@ w@@ : There will be to@@ o much ra@@ in, not en@@ ough ra@@ in, things will change in ways that their frag@@ ile en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment sim@@ pl@@ y can't su@@ pp@@ or@@ t.
And that le@@ ad@@ s to star@@ v@@ ation, it le@@ ad@@ s to un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ t@@ y, it le@@ ad@@ s to un@@ res@@ t.
So, the c@@ lim@@ ate chang@@ es will be ter@@ ri@@ ble for them.
Al@@ so, the pri@@ ce of energ@@ y is very import@@ ant to them.
In fac@@ t, if you could pic@@ k just one thing to lo@@ wer the pri@@ ce of@@ , to re@@ du@@ ce po@@ ver@@ t@@ y, by f@@ ar you would pic@@ k energ@@ y.
Now, the pri@@ ce of energ@@ y has come down over time.
Re@@ ally ad@@ v@@ anc@@ ed ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation is bas@@ ed on ad@@ v@@ anc@@ es in energ@@ y.
The co@@ al re@@ vol@@ u@@ tion fu@@ el@@ ed the In@@ du@@ stri@@ al R@@ evol@@ u@@ tion, and, even in the 19@@ 00@@ s we've se@@ en a very ra@@ pi@@ d de@@ c@@ l@@ ine in the pri@@ ce of el@@ ec@@ tri@@ c@@ ity, and that's why we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ at@@ or@@ s, a@@ ir@@ -@@ con@@ diti@@ on@@ ing, we can make mo@@ dern mat@@ eri@@ als and do so many thing@@ s.
And so, we're in a w@@ onder@@ ful s@@ itu@@ ation with el@@ ec@@ tri@@ c@@ ity in the r@@ ich world.
Bu@@ t, as we make it ch@@ e@@ ap@@ er -- and l@@ et's go for ma@@ king it t@@ wi@@ ce as ch@@ e@@ a@@ p -- we need to me@@ et a new con@@ st@@ ra@@ in@@ t, and that con@@ st@@ ra@@ in@@ t has to do with C@@ O@@ 2@@ .
C@@ O@@ 2 is war@@ m@@ ing the plan@@ et, and the e@@ qu@@ ation on C@@ O@@ 2 is actually a very st@@ ra@@ igh@@ t@@ for@@ war@@ d on@@ e.
If you s@@ um up the C@@ O@@ 2 that get@@ s em@@ it@@ te@@ d, that le@@ ad@@ s to a tem@@ per@@ at@@ ure incre@@ as@@ e, and that tem@@ per@@ at@@ ure incre@@ ase le@@ ad@@ s to some very ne@@ g@@ ative eff@@ ec@@ ts@@ : the eff@@ ec@@ ts on the we@@ a@@ ther@@ ; per@@ ha@@ ps wor@@ se, the in@@ di@@ rec@@ t eff@@ ec@@ t@@ s, in that the nat@@ ur@@ al ec@@ o@@ system@@ s can't ad@@ just to these ra@@ pi@@ d ch@@ an@@ ges@@ , and so you get ec@@ o@@ system c@@ oll@@ ap@@ s@@ es.
Now, the ex@@ ac@@ t am@@ oun@@ t of how you ma@@ p from a cer@@ ta@@ in incre@@ ase of C@@ O@@ 2 to what tem@@ per@@ at@@ ure will be and where the pos@@ iti@@ ve fe@@ ed@@ bac@@ ks ar@@ e, there's some un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty ther@@ e, but not very mu@@ ch.
And there's cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty about how b@@ ad those eff@@ ec@@ ts will b@@ e, but they will be ex@@ tre@@ m@@ ely b@@ a@@ d.
I as@@ ked the to@@ p sci@@ enti@@ st@@ s on this se@@ ver@@ al tim@@ es@@ : D@@ o we really have to get down to ne@@ ar z@@ er@@ o@@ ?
C@@ an@@ 't we just c@@ ut it in hal@@ f or a qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ ?
And the ans@@ wer is that un@@ ti@@ l we get ne@@ ar to z@@ er@@ o, the tem@@ per@@ at@@ ure will con@@ tin@@ u@@ e to ris@@ e.
And so that's a big ch@@ all@@ eng@@ e.
It's very different than sa@@ ying "@@ We@@ 're a t@@ wel@@ v@@ e-@@ foo@@ t@@ -@@ h@@ ig@@ h tru@@ ck tr@@ ying to get un@@ der a ten@@ -@@ foo@@ t bri@@ d@@ g@@ e, and we can just sort of s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ ze under@@ ."
This is something that has to get to z@@ er@@ o.
Now, we put out a lot of car@@ b@@ on di@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ de every year@@ , over 2@@ 6 b@@ illion t@@ on@@ s.
F@@ or each Americ@@ an, it's about 20 t@@ on@@ s@@ ; for people in po@@ or coun@@ tri@@ es, it's l@@ ess than one t@@ on.
It's an a@@ ver@@ age of about fi@@ ve t@@ ons for every@@ one on the plan@@ et.
An@@ d, som@@ eh@@ o@@ w, we have to make chang@@ es that will br@@ ing that down to z@@ er@@ o.
It's been con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly going up@@ .
It's only v@@ ari@@ ous econ@@ om@@ ic chang@@ es that have even fl@@ at@@ ten@@ ed it at all@@ , so we have to go from ra@@ p@@ id@@ ly ris@@ ing to fall@@ ing, and fall@@ ing all the way to z@@ er@@ o.
This e@@ qu@@ ation has f@@ our fac@@ tor@@ s, a little bit of m@@ ul@@ ti@@ p@@ lic@@ ation@@ : So, you@@ 've got a thing on the le@@ f@@ t, C@@ O@@ 2@@ , that you want to get to z@@ er@@ o, and that's going to be bas@@ ed on the num@@ ber of peopl@@ e, the ser@@ vi@@ c@@ es each per@@ son@@ 's us@@ ing on a@@ ver@@ ag@@ e, the energ@@ y on a@@ ver@@ age for each ser@@ vi@@ c@@ e, and the C@@ O@@ 2 being put out per un@@ it of energ@@ y.
So, l@@ et's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to z@@ er@@ o.
Pro@@ bab@@ ly, one of these num@@ ber@@ s is going to have to get pre@@ tt@@ y ne@@ ar to z@@ er@@ o.
Now that's back from h@@ ig@@ h sch@@ oo@@ l al@@ ge@@ b@@ ra@@ , but l@@ et's take a loo@@ k.
F@@ ir@@ st, we've got po@@ pul@@ ation.
The world to@@ day has 6@@ .@@ 8 b@@ illion peopl@@ e.
That's he@@ ad@@ ed up to about n@@ ine b@@ illi@@ on.
Now, if we do a really great j@@ ob on new v@@ acc@@ in@@ es, he@@ al@@ th car@@ e, re@@ produc@@ tive he@@ al@@ th ser@@ vi@@ c@@ es, we could lo@@ wer that b@@ y, per@@ ha@@ p@@ s, 10 or 1@@ 5 perc@@ ent, but there we see an incre@@ ase of about 1@@ .@@ 3@@ .
The secon@@ d fac@@ t@@ or is the ser@@ vi@@ c@@ es we us@@ e.
This en@@ com@@ pas@@ s@@ es every@@ thing@@ : the foo@@ d we e@@ at@@ , c@@ lo@@ thing@@ , T@@ V@@ , he@@ at@@ ing.
Th@@ ese are very good thing@@ s@@ : get@@ ting ri@@ d of po@@ ver@@ ty me@@ ans pro@@ vi@@ ding these ser@@ vi@@ c@@ es to al@@ most every@@ one on the plan@@ et.
And it's a great thing for this num@@ ber to go up@@ .
In the r@@ ich worl@@ d, per@@ ha@@ ps the to@@ p one b@@ illi@@ on, we pro@@ bab@@ ly could c@@ ut back and use l@@ es@@ s, but every year@@ , this num@@ ber@@ , on a@@ ver@@ ag@@ e, is going to go up@@ , and so, over all@@ , that will more than d@@ ou@@ ble the ser@@ vi@@ c@@ es del@@ i@@ ver@@ ed per per@@ son@@ .
H@@ ere we have a very bas@@ ic ser@@ vi@@ c@@ e: D@@ o you have li@@ gh@@ ting in your h@@ ou@@ se to be able to re@@ ad your h@@ om@@ e@@ wor@@ k@@ ?
An@@ d, in fac@@ t, these ki@@ ds don@@ '@@ t, so they're going out and read@@ ing their sch@@ oo@@ l work un@@ der the st@@ re@@ et l@@ am@@ p@@ s.
Now, eff@@ ic@@ i@@ enc@@ y, E@@ , the energ@@ y for each ser@@ vi@@ c@@ e, here fin@@ ally we have some good ne@@ w@@ s.
We have something that's not going up@@ .
Th@@ r@@ ough v@@ ari@@ ous inv@@ en@@ tions and new ways of doing li@@ gh@@ t@@ ing, through different ty@@ p@@ es of car@@ s, different ways of build@@ ing build@@ ing@@ s -- there are a lot of ser@@ vi@@ c@@ es where you can br@@ ing the energ@@ y for that ser@@ vi@@ ce down qu@@ ite sub@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ all@@ y.
S@@ ome in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al ser@@ vi@@ c@@ es even br@@ ing it down by 9@@ 0 perc@@ ent.
There are other ser@@ vi@@ c@@ es like how we make fer@@ ti@@ li@@ z@@ er, or how we do a@@ ir tr@@ an@@ sp@@ or@@ t, where the ro@@ om@@ s for im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ent are f@@ ar@@ , f@@ ar l@@ es@@ s.
And so, o@@ ver@@ all here, if we're op@@ tim@@ ist@@ ic@@ , we ma@@ y get a re@@ duc@@ tion of a fac@@ t@@ or of three to ev@@ en, per@@ ha@@ p@@ s, a fac@@ t@@ or of si@@ x@@ .
But for these first three fac@@ tor@@ s no@@ w, we've g@@ one from 2@@ 6 b@@ illion to@@ , at bes@@ t, ma@@ y@@ be 1@@ 3 b@@ illion t@@ on@@ s, and that just w@@ on@@ 't c@@ ut it.
So l@@ et's look at this f@@ our@@ th fac@@ t@@ or -- this is going to be a k@@ ey one -- and this is the am@@ oun@@ t of C@@ O@@ 2 put out per each un@@ it of energ@@ y.
And so the ques@@ tion is@@ : C@@ an you actually get that to z@@ er@@ o@@ ?
If you b@@ ur@@ n co@@ al, no@@ .
If you b@@ ur@@ n nat@@ ur@@ al g@@ as@@ , no@@ .
Al@@ most every way we make el@@ ec@@ tri@@ c@@ ity to@@ da@@ y, ex@@ c@@ ep@@ t for the em@@ erg@@ ing r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ ab@@ les and nu@@ c@@ lear@@ , p@@ ut@@ s out C@@ O@@ 2@@ .
And so, what we're going to have to do at a glob@@ al sc@@ al@@ e, is cre@@ ate a new system@@ .
And so, we need energ@@ y m@@ ir@@ ac@@ l@@ es.
Now, when I use the ter@@ m "@@ m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le@@ ," I don't me@@ an something that's im@@ possi@@ bl@@ e.
The m@@ ic@@ ro@@ pro@@ c@@ ess@@ or is a m@@ ir@@ ac@@ l@@ e. The per@@ son@@ al comp@@ uter is a m@@ ir@@ ac@@ l@@ e.
The Inter@@ net and its ser@@ vi@@ c@@ es are a m@@ ir@@ ac@@ l@@ e.
So, the people here have par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated in the cre@@ ation of many m@@ ir@@ ac@@ l@@ es.
U@@ su@@ ally, we don't have a de@@ ad@@ lin@@ e, where you have to get the m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le by a cer@@ ta@@ in dat@@ e.
U@@ su@@ ally, you just kind of stand b@@ y, and some come al@@ ong@@ , some don@@ '@@ t.
This is a c@@ ase where we actually have to dri@@ ve at ful@@ l spe@@ ed and get a m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le in a pre@@ tt@@ y ti@@ ght tim@@ el@@ in@@ e.
Now, I thou@@ gh@@ t, "@@ How could I really cap@@ ture th@@ is@@ ?
I@@ s there some kind of nat@@ ur@@ al ill@@ u@@ str@@ ation, some de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation that would gra@@ b peopl@@ e's imag@@ in@@ ation her@@ e@@ ?"
I thought back to a ye@@ ar ag@@ o when I br@@ ou@@ ght mo@@ s@@ qu@@ it@@ o@@ s, and som@@ eh@@ o@@ w people en@@ j@@ o@@ y@@ ed that.
It really got them inv@@ ol@@ ved in the idea of@@ , you know, there are people who li@@ ve with mo@@ s@@ qu@@ it@@ o@@ s.
So, with energ@@ y, all I could come up with is this.
I de@@ ci@@ ded that rel@@ eas@@ ing fi@@ re@@ f@@ li@@ es would be my con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion to the en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment here this year@@ .
So here we have some nat@@ ur@@ al fi@@ re@@ f@@ li@@ es.
I'm t@@ old they don't b@@ it@@ e@@ ; in fac@@ t, they might not even le@@ a@@ ve that j@@ ar@@ .
Now, there's all sor@@ ts of g@@ imm@@ ick@@ y sol@@ u@@ tions like that on@@ e, but they don't really ad@@ d up to mu@@ ch.
We need sol@@ u@@ tions -- ei@@ ther one or se@@ ver@@ al -- that have un@@ belie@@ v@@ able sc@@ ale and un@@ belie@@ v@@ able rel@@ i@@ ab@@ ili@@ t@@ y, and, al@@ th@@ ough there's many di@@ rec@@ tions people are se@@ ek@@ ing, I really only see fi@@ ve that can ach@@ ie@@ ve the big num@@ ber@@ s.
I've le@@ ft out ti@@ de, ge@@ other@@ m@@ al, f@@ us@@ i@@ on, bi@@ of@@ u@@ el@@ s.
Th@@ o@@ se ma@@ y make some con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion, and if they can do bet@@ ter than I exp@@ ec@@ t, so much the bet@@ ter, but my k@@ ey poin@@ t here is that we're going to have to work on each of these fi@@ ve, and we can't give up any of them because they look da@@ un@@ t@@ ing, because they all have s@@ ign@@ if@@ ic@@ ant ch@@ all@@ en@@ ges@@ .
L@@ et's look first at the b@@ ur@@ ning f@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ l fu@@ el@@ s, ei@@ ther b@@ ur@@ ning co@@ al or b@@ ur@@ ning nat@@ ur@@ al g@@ as@@ .
What you need to do ther@@ e, se@@ em@@ s like it might be sim@@ pl@@ e, but it's no@@ t, and that's to take all the C@@ O@@ 2@@ , after you@@ 've b@@ ur@@ n@@ ed it, going out the fl@@ u@@ e, pres@@ su@@ ri@@ ze it, cre@@ ate a li@@ qu@@ i@@ d, put it some@@ wh@@ er@@ e, and ho@@ pe it st@@ a@@ ys there.
Now we have some p@@ il@@ o@@ t things that do this at the 6@@ 0 to 8@@ 0 percent le@@ vel@@ , but get@@ ting up to that ful@@ l perc@@ ent@@ ag@@ e, that will be very tri@@ ck@@ y, and ag@@ re@@ ein@@ g on where these C@@ O@@ 2 qu@@ ant@@ iti@@ es should be put will be har@@ d, but the t@@ ou@@ gh@@ est one here is this l@@ ong@@ -@@ ter@@ m is@@ su@@ e.
W@@ ho@@ 's going to be su@@ re@@ ?
W@@ ho@@ 's going to gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e something that is li@@ ter@@ ally b@@ illi@@ ons of tim@@ es lar@@ ger than any ty@@ pe of wa@@ ste you think of in ter@@ m@@ s of nu@@ c@@ le@@ ar or other thing@@ s@@ ?
This is a lot of vol@@ um@@ e.
So that's a t@@ ough on@@ e.
N@@ ex@@ t would be nu@@ c@@ lear@@ .
It also has three big problem@@ s@@ : C@@ o@@ st, par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly in h@@ igh@@ ly re@@ g@@ ul@@ ated coun@@ tri@@ es, is h@@ igh@@ ; the is@@ su@@ e of the sa@@ f@@ et@@ y, really fe@@ el@@ ing good about no@@ thing could go w@@ r@@ ong@@ , that, even th@@ ough you have these human o@@ per@@ at@@ or@@ s, that the fu@@ el doesn't get used for we@@ ap@@ on@@ s.
And then what do you do with the wa@@ st@@ e?
An@@ d, al@@ th@@ ough it's not very lar@@ g@@ e, there are a lot of con@@ c@@ ern@@ s about that.
P@@ e@@ o@@ ple need to fe@@ el good about it.
So three very t@@ ough problem@@ s that might be sol@@ v@@ abl@@ e, and so, should be wor@@ ked on.
The last three of the fi@@ ve, I've gr@@ ou@@ p@@ ed toge@@ ther@@ .
Th@@ ese are what people of@@ ten re@@ f@@ er to as the r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able s@@ our@@ c@@ es.
And they actually -- al@@ th@@ ough it's great they don't re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e fu@@ el -- they have some dis@@ ad@@ v@@ ant@@ ag@@ es.
O@@ ne is that the den@@ s@@ ity of energ@@ y ga@@ ther@@ ed in these techn@@ ologi@@ es is dr@@ am@@ ati@@ c@@ ally l@@ ess than a po@@ wer plan@@ t.
This is energ@@ y f@@ ar@@ m@@ ing, so you're tal@@ king about many s@@ qu@@ are m@@ il@@ es, thou@@ s@@ and@@ s of time more ar@@ e@@ a than you think of as a nor@@ mal energ@@ y plan@@ t.
Al@@ so, these are inter@@ mit@@ t@@ ent s@@ our@@ c@@ es.
The su@@ n doesn't sh@@ ine all da@@ y, it doesn't sh@@ ine every da@@ y, and, lik@@ e@@ wis@@ e, the w@@ ind doesn't b@@ lo@@ w all the time.
And so, if you de@@ p@@ end on these s@@ our@@ c@@ es, you have to have some way of get@@ ting the energ@@ y dur@@ ing those time per@@ i@@ o@@ ds that it's not av@@ a@@ il@@ abl@@ e.
So, we've got big co@@ st ch@@ all@@ eng@@ es here, we have trans@@ mis@@ sion ch@@ all@@ en@@ ges@@ : for exam@@ pl@@ e, say this energ@@ y s@@ our@@ ce is ou@@ t@@ side your coun@@ tr@@ y@@ ; you not only need the technolog@@ y, but you have to de@@ al with the ris@@ k of the energ@@ y com@@ ing from el@@ se@@ wh@@ er@@ e.
An@@ d, fin@@ ally, this stor@@ age problem@@ .
An@@ d, to di@@ men@@ si@@ on@@ al@@ iz@@ e this, I went through and loo@@ ked at all the ty@@ p@@ es of b@@ at@@ ter@@ ies that get made -- for car@@ s, for comp@@ u@@ ter@@ s, for ph@@ on@@ es, for f@@ las@@ h@@ li@@ gh@@ t@@ s, for every@@ thing -- and com@@ par@@ ed that to the am@@ oun@@ t of el@@ ec@@ tri@@ c@@ al energ@@ y the world us@@ es, and what I found is that all the b@@ at@@ ter@@ ies we make now could stor@@ e l@@ ess than 10 min@@ ut@@ es of all the energ@@ y.
And so, in fac@@ t, we need a big bre@@ ak@@ through here, something that's going to be a fac@@ t@@ or of 100 bet@@ ter than the ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es we have no@@ w.
It's not im@@ possi@@ bl@@ e, but it's not a very eas@@ y thing@@ .
Now, this sho@@ ws up when you try to get the inter@@ mit@@ t@@ ent s@@ our@@ ce to be ab@@ o@@ ve, say, 20 to 3@@ 0 percent of what you're us@@ ing.
If you're coun@@ ting on it for 100 perc@@ ent, you need an incre@@ di@@ ble m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le b@@ at@@ ter@@ y.
Now, how we're going to go for@@ war@@ d on this -- wh@@ at's the right ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ ?
I@@ s it a M@@ an@@ hat@@ t@@ an Pro@@ jec@@ t? W@@ hat@@ 's the thing that can get us ther@@ e?
Well, we need lo@@ ts of comp@@ an@@ ies wor@@ king on this, h@@ und@@ re@@ d@@ s.
In each of these fi@@ ve pa@@ th@@ s, we need at le@@ ast a h@@ und@@ red peopl@@ e.
And a lot of them@@ , you@@ 'll look at and say, "@@ Th@@ ey@@ 're c@@ ra@@ z@@ y@@ ." That's go@@ o@@ d.
An@@ d, I thin@@ k, here in the TED gr@@ ou@@ p@@ , we have many people who are al@@ read@@ y p@@ ur@@ su@@ ing this.
B@@ ill G@@ ros@@ s has se@@ ver@@ al comp@@ an@@ i@@ es, in@@ c@@ lu@@ ding one called e@@ S@@ ol@@ ar that has some great sol@@ ar ther@@ mal techn@@ ologi@@ es.
V@@ in@@ od K@@ ho@@ s@@ la@@ 's inv@@ es@@ ting in do@@ z@@ ens of comp@@ an@@ ies that are doing great things and have interes@@ ting possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ti@@ es, and I'm tr@@ ying to hel@@ p back that.
N@@ a@@ than M@@ y@@ hr@@ v@@ old and I actually are bac@@ king a comp@@ any that, per@@ ha@@ ps sur@@ pr@@ is@@ ing@@ ly, is actually ta@@ king the nu@@ c@@ le@@ ar ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ .
There are some in@@ no@@ v@@ ations in nu@@ c@@ lear@@ : mo@@ d@@ ul@@ ar@@ , li@@ qu@@ i@@ d.
And in@@ no@@ v@@ ation really sto@@ pp@@ ed in this in@@ du@@ str@@ y qu@@ ite some ag@@ o, so the idea that there's some good ide@@ as la@@ ying around is not all that sur@@ pr@@ is@@ ing.
The idea of T@@ er@@ ra@@ Po@@ wer is that, in@@ ste@@ ad of b@@ ur@@ ning a part of ur@@ an@@ i@@ um -- the one perc@@ ent, which is the U@@ 2@@ 3@@ 5 -- we de@@ ci@@ de@@ d, "@@ L@@ et's b@@ ur@@ n the 9@@ 9 perc@@ ent, the U@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8@@ ."
It is kind of a c@@ ra@@ z@@ y ide@@ a.
In fac@@ t, people had tal@@ ked about it for a long time, but they could never sim@@ ul@@ ate pro@@ per@@ ly wh@@ e@@ ther it would work or no@@ t, and so it's through the ad@@ v@@ ent of mo@@ dern su@@ per@@ comp@@ u@@ ter@@ s that now you can sim@@ ul@@ ate and see that, y@@ es, with the right mat@@ eri@@ al@@ 's ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ , this loo@@ ks like it would wor@@ k.
An@@ d, because you're b@@ ur@@ ning that 9@@ 9 perc@@ ent, you have gre@@ at@@ ly im@@ pro@@ ved co@@ st pro@@ f@@ il@@ e.
You actually b@@ ur@@ n up the wa@@ st@@ e, and you can actually use as fu@@ el all the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver wa@@ ste from to@@ da@@ y@@ 's re@@ ac@@ tor@@ s.
So, in@@ ste@@ ad of wor@@ r@@ ying about them@@ , you just take that. It's a great thing@@ .
It bre@@ a@@ th@@ es this ur@@ an@@ i@@ um as it go@@ es al@@ ong@@ , so it's kind of like a c@@ and@@ l@@ e.
You can see it's a lo@@ g ther@@ e, of@@ ten re@@ fer@@ red to as a tra@@ vel@@ ing wa@@ ve re@@ ac@@ tor@@ .
In ter@@ m@@ s of fu@@ el@@ , this really sol@@ ves the problem@@ .
I've got a pic@@ ture here of a plac@@ e in K@@ ent@@ u@@ ck@@ y.
This is the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver@@ , the 9@@ 9 perc@@ ent, where they@@ 've ta@@ ken out the part they b@@ ur@@ n no@@ w, so it's called de@@ pl@@ et@@ ed ur@@ an@@ i@@ um@@ .
That would po@@ wer the U@@ .@@ S@@ . for h@@ und@@ re@@ ds of year@@ s.
An@@ d, sim@@ pl@@ y by f@@ il@@ ter@@ ing se@@ a@@ wat@@ er in an in@@ exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve pro@@ c@@ es@@ s, you@@ '@@ d have en@@ ough fu@@ el for the enti@@ re li@@ fe@@ time of the res@@ t of the plan@@ et.
So, you know, it's got lo@@ ts of ch@@ all@@ eng@@ es ah@@ e@@ a@@ d, but it is an exam@@ ple of the many h@@ und@@ re@@ ds and h@@ und@@ re@@ ds of ide@@ as that we need to mo@@ ve for@@ war@@ d.
So l@@ et's thin@@ k@@ : How should we me@@ as@@ ure our@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ ?
What should our re@@ p@@ ort car@@ d look lik@@ e?
Well, l@@ et's go out to where we really need to get@@ , and then look at the inter@@ me@@ di@@ at@@ e.
F@@ or 20@@ 5@@ 0@@ , you@@ 've hear@@ d many people talk about this 8@@ 0 percent re@@ duc@@ tion.
That really is very import@@ an@@ t, that we get there.
And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in po@@ or coun@@ tri@@ es, still some ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ tu@@ re, ho@@ pe@@ ful@@ ly we will have c@@ le@@ an@@ ed up for@@ es@@ tr@@ y, c@@ em@@ ent.
So, to get to that 8@@ 0 perc@@ ent, the devel@@ op@@ ed coun@@ tri@@ es, in@@ c@@ lu@@ ding coun@@ tri@@ es like Chin@@ a, will have had to s@@ wit@@ ch their el@@ ec@@ tri@@ c@@ ity gener@@ ation al@@ toge@@ ther@@ .
So, the other gra@@ de is@@ : A@@ re we de@@ pl@@ o@@ ying this z@@ er@@ o@@ -@@ em@@ is@@ sion technolog@@ y, have we de@@ pl@@ o@@ y@@ ed it in all the devel@@ op@@ ed coun@@ tri@@ es and we're in the pro@@ c@@ ess of get@@ ting it el@@ se@@ wh@@ er@@ e?
That's su@@ per import@@ an@@ t.
That's a k@@ ey el@@ em@@ ent of ma@@ king that re@@ p@@ ort car@@ d.
So, bac@@ king up from ther@@ e, what should the 20@@ 20 re@@ p@@ ort car@@ d look lik@@ e?
Well, again@@ , it should have the two el@@ em@@ ent@@ s.
We should go through these eff@@ ic@@ i@@ enc@@ y me@@ as@@ ur@@ es to start get@@ ting re@@ duc@@ tion@@ s@@ : The l@@ ess we em@@ it, the l@@ ess that s@@ um will be of C@@ O@@ 2@@ , and, ther@@ e@@ for@@ e, the l@@ ess the tem@@ per@@ at@@ u@@ re.
But in some wa@@ y@@ s, the gra@@ de we get ther@@ e, doing things that don't get us all the way to the big re@@ duc@@ tion@@ s, is only e@@ qu@@ ally, or ma@@ y@@ be even s@@ li@@ gh@@ t@@ ly l@@ es@@ s, import@@ ant than the other@@ , which is the pi@@ ec@@ e of in@@ no@@ v@@ ation on these bre@@ ak@@ thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ s.
Th@@ ese bre@@ ak@@ thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ s, we need to mo@@ ve those at ful@@ l spe@@ ed, and we can me@@ as@@ ure that in ter@@ m@@ s of comp@@ an@@ i@@ es, p@@ il@@ o@@ t pro@@ jec@@ t@@ s, re@@ g@@ ul@@ at@@ or@@ y things that have been ch@@ an@@ ge@@ d.
Ther@@ e's a lot of great bo@@ o@@ ks that have been w@@ rit@@ ten about this.
The A@@ l G@@ or@@ e bo@@ o@@ k, "@@ O@@ ur C@@ ho@@ ic@@ e@@ " and the D@@ a@@ vi@@ d M@@ c@@ K@@ a@@ y bo@@ o@@ k, "@@ Su@@ st@@ ain@@ able En@@ erg@@ y W@@ i@@ th@@ out the Ho@@ t A@@ ir@@ ."
They really go through it and cre@@ ate a fr@@ am@@ e@@ work that this can be dis@@ c@@ us@@ s@@ ed b@@ ro@@ ad@@ ly, because we need b@@ ro@@ ad bac@@ king for this.
Ther@@ e's a lot that has to come toge@@ ther@@ .
So this is a wis@@ h@@ .
It's a very con@@ cre@@ te wis@@ h that we inv@@ ent this technolog@@ y.
If you ga@@ ve me only one wis@@ h for the next 50 years -- I could pic@@ k wh@@ o@@ 's pres@@ i@@ den@@ t, I could pic@@ k a v@@ acc@@ in@@ e, which is something I lo@@ ve, or I could pic@@ k that this thing that's hal@@ f the co@@ st with no C@@ O@@ 2 get@@ s inv@@ ent@@ ed -- this is the wis@@ h I would pic@@ k.
This is the one with the gre@@ at@@ est imp@@ ac@@ t.
If we don't get this wis@@ h, the di@@ vis@@ ion between the people who think sh@@ ort ter@@ m and long ter@@ m will be ter@@ ri@@ bl@@ e, between the U@@ .@@ S@@ . and Chin@@ a, between po@@ or coun@@ tri@@ es and rich@@ , and most of all the li@@ ves of those two b@@ illion will be f@@ ar wor@@ se.
So, what do we have to do@@ ?
What am I ap@@ pe@@ al@@ ing to you to ste@@ p for@@ war@@ d and dri@@ v@@ e?
We need to go for more res@@ ear@@ ch f@@ und@@ ing.
When coun@@ tri@@ es get toge@@ ther in plac@@ es like C@@ op@@ en@@ h@@ ag@@ en, they sh@@ oul@@ dn't just dis@@ c@@ us@@ s the C@@ O@@ 2@@ .
They should dis@@ c@@ us@@ s this in@@ no@@ v@@ ation ag@@ en@@ da@@ , and you@@ '@@ d be st@@ un@@ n@@ ed at the ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous@@ ly lo@@ w le@@ vel@@ s of sp@@ end@@ ing on these in@@ no@@ v@@ ative ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es.
We do need the mark@@ et in@@ c@@ enti@@ ves -- C@@ O@@ 2 ta@@ x@@ , c@@ a@@ p and tra@@ de -- something that get@@ s that pri@@ ce s@@ ign@@ al out there.
We need to get the m@@ es@@ sag@@ e ou@@ t.
We need to have this di@@ al@@ og@@ u@@ e be a more r@@ ation@@ al, more under@@ stand@@ able di@@ al@@ og@@ u@@ e, in@@ c@@ lu@@ ding the st@@ ep@@ s that the go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment ta@@ k@@ es.
This is an import@@ ant wis@@ h, but it is one I think we can ach@@ ie@@ ve.
Thank you.
Thank you.
C@@ hr@@ is An@@ der@@ son@@ : Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. So to under@@ stand more about T@@ er@@ ra@@ Po@@ wer@@ , right -- I me@@ an, first of all@@ , can you give a sen@@ se of what sc@@ ale of inv@@ est@@ ment this is@@ ?
Bi@@ l G@@ at@@ es@@ : T@@ o actually do the so@@ ft@@ war@@ e, bu@@ y the su@@ per@@ comp@@ u@@ ter, h@@ ir@@ e all the great sci@@ enti@@ st@@ s, which we've don@@ e, that's only ten@@ s of m@@ illi@@ on@@ s, and even on@@ ce we t@@ est our mat@@ eri@@ als out in a R@@ us@@ si@@ an re@@ ac@@ t@@ or to make s@@ ure that our mat@@ eri@@ als work pro@@ per@@ ly, then you@@ 'll only be up in the h@@ und@@ re@@ ds of m@@ illi@@ on@@ s.
The t@@ ough thing is build@@ ing the p@@ il@@ o@@ t re@@ ac@@ tor@@ ; fin@@ ding the se@@ ver@@ al b@@ illi@@ on, fin@@ ding the re@@ g@@ ul@@ at@@ or@@ , the lo@@ c@@ ation that will actually bu@@ ild the first one of th@@ es@@ e.
O@@ n@@ ce you get the first one bu@@ il@@ t, if it wor@@ ks as ad@@ ver@@ t@@ is@@ ed, then it's just c@@ le@@ ar as da@@ y, because the econ@@ om@@ ic@@ s, the energ@@ y den@@ sit@@ y, are so different than nu@@ c@@ le@@ ar as we know it.
C@@ A@@ : And so, to under@@ stand it righ@@ t, this inv@@ ol@@ ves build@@ ing de@@ ep into the gro@@ und al@@ most like a ver@@ tic@@ al kind of col@@ um@@ n of nu@@ c@@ le@@ ar fu@@ el@@ , of this sort of sp@@ ent ur@@ an@@ i@@ um@@ , and then the pro@@ c@@ ess star@@ ts at the to@@ p and kind of wor@@ ks do@@ w@@ n@@ ?
B@@ G@@ : That's righ@@ t. T@@ o@@ da@@ y, you're al@@ ways re@@ fu@@ el@@ ing the re@@ ac@@ tor@@ , so you have lo@@ ts of people and lo@@ ts of con@@ tro@@ l@@ s that can go w@@ r@@ ong@@ : that thing where you're op@@ en@@ ing it up and mo@@ ving things in and ou@@ t, that's not go@@ o@@ d.
So, if you have very ch@@ e@@ a@@ p fu@@ el that you can put 6@@ 0 years in -- just think of it as a lo@@ g -- put it down and not have those same compl@@ ex@@ iti@@ es.
And it just s@@ its there and b@@ ur@@ n@@ s for the 6@@ 0 year@@ s, and then it's don@@ e.
C@@ A@@ : It's a nu@@ c@@ le@@ ar po@@ wer pl@@ ant that is its own wa@@ ste dis@@ pos@@ al sol@@ u@@ tion.
B@@ G@@ : Y@@ e@@ ah@@ . Well, what happ@@ ens with the wa@@ st@@ e, you can le@@ t it s@@ it there -- there's a lot l@@ ess wa@@ ste un@@ der this ap@@ pro@@ ach -- then you can actually take that, and put it into another one and b@@ ur@@ n that.
And we start off actually by ta@@ king the wa@@ ste that ex@@ ist@@ s to@@ da@@ y, that's sit@@ ting in these co@@ ol@@ ing po@@ ol@@ s or dr@@ y c@@ as@@ king by re@@ ac@@ tor@@ s -- that's our fu@@ el to beg@@ in with@@ .
So, the thing that's been a pro@@ blem from those re@@ ac@@ tor@@ s is actually what get@@ s f@@ ed into our@@ s, and you're re@@ duc@@ ing the vol@@ um@@ e of the wa@@ ste qu@@ ite dr@@ am@@ ati@@ c@@ ally as you're going through this pro@@ c@@ es@@ s.
C@@ A@@ : I me@@ an, you're tal@@ king to different people around the world about the possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ti@@ es here.
W@@ here is there most inter@@ est in actually doing something with th@@ is@@ ?
B@@ G@@ : Well, we ha@@ ven@@ 't pic@@ ked a par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar plac@@ e, and there's all these interes@@ ting dis@@ c@@ los@@ ure r@@ ul@@ es about any@@ thing that's called "@@ nu@@ c@@ lear@@ ," so we've got a lot of interes@@ t, that people from the comp@@ any have been in R@@ us@@ si@@ a, Indi@@ a, Chin@@ a -- I've been back se@@ ein@@ g the s@@ ec@@ re@@ t@@ ary of energ@@ y here, tal@@ king about how this f@@ its into the energ@@ y ag@@ en@@ da@@ .
So I'm op@@ tim@@ ist@@ ic@@ . You know, the Fr@@ en@@ ch and J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese have d@@ one some wor@@ k.
This is a v@@ ari@@ ant on something that has been don@@ e.
It's an import@@ ant ad@@ v@@ anc@@ e, but it's like a f@@ ast re@@ ac@@ tor@@ , and a lot of coun@@ tri@@ es have bu@@ il@@ t them@@ , so any@@ body wh@@ o@@ 's d@@ one a f@@ ast re@@ ac@@ t@@ or is a can@@ di@@ d@@ ate to be where the first one get@@ s bu@@ il@@ t.
C@@ A@@ : So, in your min@@ d, tim@@ es@@ c@@ ale and lik@@ el@@ i@@ ho@@ od of actually ta@@ king something like this li@@ v@@ e?
B@@ G@@ : Well, we need -- for one of these h@@ igh@@ -@@ sc@@ al@@ e, el@@ ec@@ tro@@ -@@ gener@@ ation things that's very ch@@ e@@ ap@@ , we have 20 years to inv@@ ent and then 20 years to de@@ pl@@ o@@ y.
That's sort of the de@@ ad@@ l@@ ine that the en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment@@ al mo@@ del@@ s have sho@@ wn us that we have to me@@ et.
An@@ d, you know, T@@ er@@ ra@@ Po@@ wer@@ , if things go wel@@ l -- which is wis@@ h@@ ing for a lot -- could eas@@ il@@ y me@@ et that.
And there ar@@ e, for@@ tun@@ at@@ ely no@@ w, do@@ z@@ ens of comp@@ an@@ ies -- we need it to be h@@ und@@ re@@ ds -- wh@@ o, lik@@ e@@ wis@@ e, if their sci@@ ence go@@ es w@@ ell, if the f@@ und@@ ing for their p@@ il@@ o@@ t plan@@ ts go@@ es w@@ ell, that they can comp@@ ete for this.
And it's bes@@ t if m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ple su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ ed, because then you could use a m@@ i@@ x of these thing@@ s.
We cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly need one to su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ ed.
C@@ A@@ : In ter@@ m@@ s of b@@ ig@@ -@@ sc@@ ale possi@@ ble g@@ ame ch@@ an@@ ges@@ , is this the b@@ ig@@ ges@@ t that you're a@@ w@@ are of out ther@@ e?
B@@ G@@ : A@@ n energ@@ y bre@@ ak@@ through is the most import@@ ant thing@@ .
It would have be@@ en, even with@@ out the en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment@@ al con@@ st@@ ra@@ in@@ t, but the en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment@@ al con@@ st@@ ra@@ in@@ t just ma@@ kes it so much gre@@ at@@ er.
In the nu@@ c@@ le@@ ar spac@@ e, there are other in@@ no@@ v@@ at@@ or@@ s.
You know, we don't know their work as wel@@ l as we know this on@@ e, but the mo@@ d@@ ul@@ ar peopl@@ e, that's a different ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ .
Ther@@ e's a li@@ qu@@ id@@ -@@ ty@@ pe re@@ ac@@ tor@@ , which se@@ em@@ s a little har@@ d, but ma@@ y@@ be they say that about us@@ .
And so, there are different on@@ es, but the be@@ au@@ ty of this is a m@@ ol@@ ec@@ u@@ le of ur@@ an@@ i@@ um has a million tim@@ es as much energ@@ y as a m@@ ol@@ ec@@ u@@ le of@@ , say, co@@ al, and so -- if you can de@@ al with the ne@@ g@@ ati@@ v@@ es, which are ess@@ enti@@ ally the ra@@ di@@ ation -- the foo@@ t@@ pr@@ in@@ t and co@@ st, the po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al, in ter@@ m@@ s of eff@@ ect on l@@ and and v@@ ari@@ ous thing@@ s, is al@@ most in a c@@ las@@ s of its o@@ w@@ n.
C@@ A@@ : If this doesn't wor@@ k, then wh@@ at@@ ?
D@@ o we have to start ta@@ king em@@ er@@ gen@@ c@@ y me@@ as@@ ur@@ es to try and ke@@ ep the tem@@ per@@ at@@ ure of the ear@@ th st@@ ab@@ le@@ ?
B@@ G@@ : If you get into that s@@ itu@@ ation, it's like if you@@ 've been o@@ ver@@ -@@ e@@ at@@ ing, and you're about to have a hear@@ t at@@ t@@ ack@@ : Th@@ en where do you go@@ ? You ma@@ y need hear@@ t sur@@ ger@@ y or some@@ thing@@ .
There is a l@@ ine of res@@ ear@@ ch on wh@@ at's called ge@@ o@@ eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing, which are v@@ ari@@ ous techn@@ i@@ qu@@ es that would del@@ a@@ y the he@@ ating to bu@@ y us 20 or 3@@ 0 years to get our ac@@ t toge@@ ther@@ .
Now, that's just an in@@ sur@@ ance po@@ lic@@ y.
You ho@@ pe you don't need to do that.
S@@ ome people say you sh@@ oul@@ dn't even work on the in@@ sur@@ ance po@@ lic@@ y because it might make you la@@ z@@ y, that you@@ 'll ke@@ ep e@@ ating because you know hear@@ t sur@@ ger@@ y will be there to sa@@ ve you.
I'm not s@@ ure that's wis@@ e, gi@@ ven the import@@ ance of the problem@@ , but there's now the ge@@ o@@ eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing dis@@ c@@ us@@ sion about -- should that be in the back po@@ ck@@ et in c@@ ase things happ@@ en f@@ ast@@ er, or this in@@ no@@ v@@ ation go@@ es a lot s@@ lo@@ wer than we exp@@ ec@@ t?
C@@ A@@ : C@@ lim@@ ate sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ s@@ : If you had a s@@ ent@@ ence or two to say to them@@ , how might you per@@ su@@ ade them that they're w@@ r@@ ong@@ ?
B@@ G@@ : Well, un@@ for@@ tun@@ at@@ el@@ y, the sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ s come in different c@@ am@@ p@@ s.
The on@@ es who make sci@@ enti@@ f@@ ic ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents are very fe@@ w.
A@@ re they sa@@ ying that there's ne@@ g@@ ative fe@@ ed@@ back eff@@ ec@@ ts that have to do with c@@ l@@ ou@@ ds that off@@ se@@ t thing@@ s@@ ?
There are ver@@ y, very few things that they can even say there's a ch@@ ance in a million of those thing@@ s.
The ma@@ in pro@@ blem we have here, it's kind of like A@@ I@@ D@@ S@@ .
You make the m@@ ist@@ a@@ ke no@@ w, and you pa@@ y for it a lot lat@@ er.
And so, when you have all sor@@ ts of ur@@ gen@@ t problem@@ s, the idea of ta@@ king pa@@ in now that has to do with a ga@@ in lat@@ er, and a some@@ what un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in pa@@ in thing -- in fac@@ t, the I@@ P@@ C@@ C re@@ p@@ or@@ t, that's not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ il@@ y the wor@@ st c@@ as@@ e, and there are people in the r@@ ich world who look at I@@ P@@ C@@ C and say, "@@ OK@@ , that is@@ n't that big of a de@@ al@@ ."
The fac@@ t is it's that un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in part that should mo@@ ve us to@@ war@@ ds this.
But my dre@@ am here is that, if you can make it econ@@ om@@ ic@@ , and me@@ et the C@@ O@@ 2 con@@ st@@ ra@@ in@@ t@@ s, then the sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ s say, "@@ OK@@ , I don't c@@ are that it doesn't put out C@@ O@@ 2@@ , I kind of wis@@ h it did put out C@@ O@@ 2@@ , but I gu@@ ess I'@@ ll acc@@ ep@@ t it because it's ch@@ e@@ ap@@ er than wh@@ at's come befor@@ e@@ ."
C@@ A@@ : And so, that would be your res@@ p@@ on@@ se to the B@@ j@@ or@@ n L@@ om@@ b@@ or@@ g ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent, that bas@@ ic@@ ally if you sp@@ end all this energ@@ y tr@@ ying to sol@@ ve the C@@ O@@ 2 problem@@ , it's going to take a@@ way all your other go@@ als of tr@@ ying to ri@@ d the world of po@@ ver@@ ty and m@@ al@@ ari@@ a and so for@@ th@@ , it's a stu@@ pi@@ d wa@@ ste of the E@@ ar@@ th@@ 's res@@ our@@ c@@ es to put mon@@ ey to@@ war@@ ds that when there are bet@@ ter things we can do@@ .
B@@ G@@ : Well, the actu@@ al sp@@ end@@ ing on the R@@ &@@ am@@ p@@ ;@@ D pi@@ ec@@ e -- say the U@@ .@@ S@@ . should sp@@ end 10 b@@ illion a ye@@ ar more than it is right now -- it's not that dr@@ am@@ ati@@ c@@ .
It sh@@ oul@@ dn't take a@@ way from other thing@@ s.
The thing you get into big mon@@ ey on, and this, reas@@ on@@ able people can dis@@ ag@@ re@@ e, is when you have something that's n@@ on@@ -@@ econ@@ om@@ ic and you're tr@@ ying to f@@ und that -- that, to me, mo@@ st@@ ly is a wa@@ st@@ e.
Un@@ l@@ ess you're very c@@ lo@@ se and you're just f@@ und@@ ing the lear@@ ning c@@ ur@@ ve and it's going to get very ch@@ e@@ ap@@ , I belie@@ ve we should try more things that have a po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al to be f@@ ar l@@ ess exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve.
If the tra@@ de@@ -@@ off you get into is, "@@ L@@ et's make energ@@ y su@@ per exp@@ en@@ si@@ v@@ e@@ ," then the r@@ ich can aff@@ or@@ d that.
I me@@ an, all of us here could pa@@ y fi@@ ve tim@@ es as much for our energ@@ y and not change our lif@@ est@@ y@@ l@@ e.
The dis@@ ast@@ er is for that two b@@ illi@@ on.
And even L@@ om@@ b@@ or@@ g has ch@@ an@@ ge@@ d.
H@@ is sh@@ ti@@ ck now is, "@@ Wh@@ y is@@ n't the R@@ &@@ am@@ p@@ ;@@ D get@@ ting more dis@@ c@@ us@@ se@@ d@@ ?"
H@@ e's st@@ ill@@ , because of his ear@@ li@@ er stu@@ ff@@ , still as@@ soci@@ ated with the sk@@ ep@@ ti@@ c c@@ am@@ p@@ , but h@@ e's real@@ iz@@ ed that's a pre@@ tt@@ y l@@ on@@ ely c@@ am@@ p@@ , and so, h@@ e's ma@@ king the R@@ &@@ am@@ p@@ ;@@ D poin@@ t.
And so there is a thre@@ ad of something that I think is ap@@ pro@@ pri@@ at@@ e.
The R@@ &@@ am@@ p@@ ;@@ D pi@@ ec@@ e, it's c@@ ra@@ z@@ y how little it's f@@ un@@ de@@ d.
C@@ A@@ : Wel@@ l B@@ ill@@ , I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect I spe@@ a@@ k on the beh@@ al@@ f of most people here to say I really ho@@ pe your wis@@ h comes tru@@ e. Thank you so mu@@ ch.
B@@ G@@ : Thank you.
I'@@ d like to sh@@ are with you a dis@@ co@@ very that I made a few mon@@ th@@ s ag@@ o wh@@ ile w@@ rit@@ ing an ar@@ tic@@ le for It@@ ali@@ an W@@ i@@ re@@ d.
I al@@ ways ke@@ ep my th@@ es@@ au@@ ru@@ s h@@ and@@ y wh@@ en@@ ever I'm w@@ rit@@ ing any@@ thing@@ , but I'@@ d al@@ read@@ y fin@@ is@@ h@@ ed ed@@ it@@ ing the pi@@ ec@@ e, and I real@@ iz@@ ed that I had never on@@ ce in my life loo@@ ked up the wor@@ d "@@ dis@@ ab@@ le@@ d@@ " to see what I'@@ d fin@@ d.
L@@ et me re@@ ad you the ent@@ r@@ y.
"@@ D@@ is@@ ab@@ le@@ d, ad@@ jec@@ tiv@@ e: c@@ rip@@ pl@@ ed, hel@@ pl@@ es@@ s, us@@ el@@ es@@ s, w@@ re@@ ck@@ ed, st@@ all@@ ed, ma@@ im@@ ed, w@@ oun@@ de@@ d, m@@ ang@@ le@@ d, l@@ am@@ e, mu@@ ti@@ lat@@ ed, r@@ un@@ -@@ do@@ w@@ n, wor@@ n@@ -@@ ou@@ t, we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed, im@@ po@@ ten@@ t, c@@ a@@ str@@ at@@ ed, par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed, h@@ an@@ dic@@ ap@@ pe@@ d, sen@@ il@@ e, de@@ cre@@ p@@ it, la@@ id@@ -@@ up@@ , don@@ e-@@ up@@ , don@@ e-@@ for@@ , don@@ e-@@ in c@@ r@@ ack@@ ed@@ -@@ up@@ , coun@@ te@@ d@@ -@@ ou@@ t@@ ; see also h@@ ur@@ t, us@@ el@@ ess and we@@ ak@@ .
An@@ t@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ s, he@@ al@@ th@@ y, str@@ ong@@ , cap@@ ab@@ le@@ ."
I was read@@ ing this li@@ st out l@@ ou@@ d to a fri@@ end and at first was l@@ au@@ gh@@ ing, it was so lu@@ dic@@ r@@ ou@@ s, but I'@@ d just go@@ t@@ ten pas@@ t "@@ m@@ ang@@ le@@ d@@ ," and my v@@ o@@ ice b@@ ro@@ k@@ e, and I had to sto@@ p and col@@ le@@ c@@ t m@@ y@@ sel@@ f from the em@@ o@@ tion@@ al sho@@ ck and imp@@ ac@@ t that the ass@@ au@@ l@@ t from these wor@@ ds un@@ le@@ as@@ he@@ d.
You know, of cour@@ se, this is my r@@ ag@@ ge@@ dy old th@@ es@@ au@@ ru@@ s so I'm thin@@ king this m@@ ust be an an@@ ci@@ ent pr@@ in@@ t dat@@ e, righ@@ t?
Bu@@ t, in fac@@ t, the pr@@ in@@ t d@@ ate was the ear@@ ly 19@@ 8@@ 0@@ s, when I would have been star@@ ting pri@@ mar@@ y sch@@ oo@@ l and form@@ ing an under@@ stand@@ ing of m@@ y@@ sel@@ f ou@@ t@@ side the fam@@ il@@ y un@@ it and as rel@@ ated to the other ki@@ ds and the world around m@@ e.
An@@ d, ne@@ ed@@ l@@ ess to say, th@@ ank G@@ od I was@@ n't us@@ ing a th@@ es@@ au@@ ru@@ s back th@@ en.
I me@@ an, from this ent@@ r@@ y, it would se@@ em that I was b@@ or@@ n into a world that perc@@ ei@@ ved some@@ one like me to have no@@ thing pos@@ iti@@ ve wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever going for them@@ , when in fac@@ t, to@@ day I'm c@@ el@@ eb@@ r@@ ated for the o@@ pp@@ ort@@ un@@ iti@@ es and ad@@ v@@ ent@@ ur@@ es my life has pro@@ c@@ u@@ re@@ d.
So, I im@@ me@@ di@@ at@@ ely went to look up the 200@@ 9 on@@ l@@ ine ed@@ iti@@ on, exp@@ ec@@ ting to find a re@@ vis@@ ion wor@@ th no@@ t@@ ing.
Her@@ e's the up@@ d@@ ated ver@@ sion of this ent@@ r@@ y.
Un@@ for@@ tun@@ at@@ el@@ y, it's not much bet@@ ter.
I find the last two wor@@ ds un@@ der "@@ Ne@@ ar An@@ t@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ s@@ ," par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly un@@ s@@ et@@ tl@@ ing@@ : "@@ wh@@ ol@@ e@@ " and "@@ wh@@ ol@@ es@@ om@@ e@@ ."
So, it's not just about the wor@@ d@@ s.
It's what we belie@@ ve about people when we n@@ ame them with these wor@@ d@@ s.
It's about the v@@ al@@ u@@ es beh@@ ind the wor@@ d@@ s, and how we con@@ stru@@ c@@ t those v@@ al@@ u@@ es.
O@@ ur lang@@ u@@ age aff@@ ec@@ ts our thin@@ king and how we vie@@ w the world and how we vie@@ w other peopl@@ e.
In fac@@ t, many an@@ ci@@ ent so@@ c@@ ie@@ ti@@ es, in@@ c@@ lu@@ ding the G@@ re@@ ek@@ s and the R@@ om@@ an@@ s, belie@@ ved that to ut@@ ter a c@@ ur@@ se ver@@ b@@ ally was so po@@ wer@@ ful@@ , because to say the thing out l@@ ou@@ d br@@ ou@@ ght it into ex@@ ist@@ enc@@ e.
So, what real@@ ity do we want to c@@ all into ex@@ ist@@ enc@@ e: a per@@ son who is li@@ mit@@ ed, or a per@@ son wh@@ o@@ 's em@@ po@@ wer@@ ed@@ ?
B@@ y c@@ as@@ u@@ ally doing something as sim@@ ple as nam@@ ing a per@@ son@@ , a chil@@ d, we might be p@@ ut@@ ting li@@ ds and c@@ ast@@ ing s@@ ha@@ do@@ ws on their po@@ wer@@ .
W@@ oul@@ dn't we want to op@@ en do@@ or@@ s for them in@@ ste@@ ad@@ ?
O@@ ne su@@ ch per@@ son who op@@ en@@ ed do@@ or@@ s for me was my ch@@ ild@@ ho@@ od do@@ c@@ t@@ or at the A@@ .@@ I@@ . du@@ P@@ on@@ t In@@ st@@ itu@@ te in W@@ il@@ m@@ ing@@ t@@ on, D@@ el@@ a@@ war@@ e.
H@@ is n@@ ame was D@@ r@@ . P@@ iz@@ z@@ u@@ ti@@ l@@ lo@@ , an It@@ ali@@ an Americ@@ an, wh@@ o@@ se nam@@ e, a@@ pp@@ ar@@ ent@@ ly, was to@@ o di@@ ff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t for most Americ@@ ans to pr@@ on@@ oun@@ c@@ e, so he went by D@@ r@@ . P@@ .
And D@@ r@@ . P al@@ ways wor@@ e really col@@ or@@ ful bo@@ w ti@@ es and had the very per@@ f@@ ect dis@@ pos@@ iti@@ on to work with childr@@ en.
I lo@@ ved al@@ most every@@ thing about my time sp@@ ent at this ho@@ sp@@ it@@ al, with the ex@@ c@@ ep@@ tion of my ph@@ ysi@@ c@@ al ther@@ ap@@ y s@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ s.
I had to do what se@@ em@@ ed like inn@@ um@@ er@@ able re@@ p@@ et@@ iti@@ ons of ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ es with these th@@ ic@@ k, el@@ ast@@ ic b@@ and@@ s -- different col@@ or@@ s, you know -- to hel@@ p bu@@ ild up my le@@ g mus@@ c@@ l@@ es, and I hat@@ ed these b@@ and@@ s more than any@@ thing -- I hat@@ ed them@@ , had nam@@ es for them. I hat@@ ed them.
An@@ d, you know, I was al@@ read@@ y bar@@ g@@ ain@@ ing, as a fi@@ ve year@@ -@@ old chil@@ d, with D@@ r@@ . P to try to get out of doing these ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ es, un@@ su@@ c@@ c@@ ess@@ ful@@ ly, of cour@@ se.
An@@ d, one da@@ y, he came in to my s@@ es@@ sion -- ex@@ h@@ au@@ st@@ i@@ ve and un@@ for@@ gi@@ v@@ ing, these s@@ es@@ si@@ ons -- and he said to me, "@@ W@@ o@@ w. A@@ im@@ e@@ e, you are su@@ ch a str@@ ong and po@@ wer@@ ful little g@@ ir@@ l@@ , I think you're going to bre@@ a@@ k one of those b@@ and@@ s.
When you do bre@@ a@@ k it, I'm going to give you a h@@ und@@ red bu@@ ck@@ s@@ ."
Now, of cour@@ se, this was a sim@@ ple pl@@ o@@ y on D@@ r@@ . P@@ 's part to get me to do the ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ es I didn't want to do befor@@ e the pro@@ spec@@ t of being the rich@@ est fi@@ v@@ e-@@ year@@ -@@ old in the secon@@ d f@@ lo@@ or war@@ d, but what he eff@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ely did for me was res@@ ha@@ pe an a@@ w@@ ful da@@ il@@ y oc@@ c@@ ur@@ r@@ ence into a new and pro@@ mis@@ ing exper@@ i@@ ence for m@@ e.
And I have to w@@ on@@ der to@@ day to what ex@@ t@@ ent his vis@@ ion and his de@@ c@@ lar@@ ation of me as a str@@ ong and po@@ wer@@ ful little g@@ ir@@ l s@@ ha@@ p@@ ed my own vie@@ w of m@@ y@@ sel@@ f as an in@@ her@@ ent@@ ly str@@ ong@@ , po@@ wer@@ ful and a@@ th@@ le@@ ti@@ c per@@ son wel@@ l into the f@@ ut@@ u@@ re.
This is an exam@@ ple of how ad@@ ul@@ ts in pos@@ iti@@ ons of po@@ wer can ign@@ ite the po@@ wer of a chil@@ d.
Bu@@ t, in the pre@@ vi@@ ous in@@ st@@ anc@@ es of those th@@ es@@ au@@ ru@@ s ent@@ ri@@ es, our lang@@ u@@ age is@@ n't all@@ o@@ wing us to evol@@ ve into the real@@ ity that we would all wan@@ t, the possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ty of an in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al to see them@@ sel@@ ves as cap@@ abl@@ e.
O@@ ur lang@@ u@@ age h@@ as@@ n't c@@ au@@ ght up with the chang@@ es in our soci@@ et@@ y, many of which have been br@@ ou@@ ght about by technolog@@ y.
C@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ly, from a me@@ dic@@ al stand@@ poin@@ t, my leg@@ s, las@@ er sur@@ ger@@ y for vis@@ ion im@@ pa@@ ir@@ men@@ t, tit@@ an@@ i@@ um k@@ ne@@ es and hi@@ p re@@ plac@@ em@@ ents for ag@@ ing bo@@ dies that are all@@ o@@ wing people to more ful@@ ly eng@@ age with their ab@@ ili@@ ti@@ es, and mo@@ ve be@@ y@@ on@@ d the li@@ mit@@ s that nat@@ ure has im@@ pos@@ ed on them -- not to men@@ tion soci@@ al net@@ wor@@ king pl@@ at@@ form@@ s all@@ o@@ w people to self@@ -@@ i@@ den@@ ti@@ f@@ y, to c@@ la@@ im their own des@@ c@@ rip@@ tions of them@@ sel@@ v@@ es,
so they can go al@@ ign with glob@@ al gr@@ ou@@ ps of their own ch@@ oo@@ s@@ ing.
So, per@@ ha@@ ps technolog@@ y is re@@ v@@ e@@ al@@ ing more c@@ lear@@ ly to us now what has al@@ ways been a tru@@ th@@ : that every@@ one has something r@@ are and po@@ wer@@ ful to off@@ er our soci@@ et@@ y, and that the human ab@@ ili@@ ty to a@@ da@@ p@@ t is our gre@@ at@@ est ass@@ et.
The human ab@@ ili@@ ty to a@@ da@@ p@@ t, it's an interes@@ ting thing@@ , because people have con@@ tin@@ u@@ ally wanted to talk to me about o@@ ver@@ com@@ ing ad@@ vers@@ ity, and I'm going to make an ad@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ : This p@@ hr@@ ase never s@@ at right with me, and I al@@ ways f@@ el@@ t un@@ eas@@ y tr@@ ying to ans@@ wer peopl@@ e's ques@@ tions about it, and I think I'm star@@ ting to f@@ ig@@ ure out wh@@ y.
I@@ m@@ p@@ lic@@ it in this p@@ hr@@ ase of "@@ o@@ ver@@ com@@ ing ad@@ vers@@ it@@ y@@ " is the idea that su@@ c@@ c@@ es@@ s, or happ@@ in@@ es@@ s, is about em@@ erg@@ ing on the other side of a ch@@ all@@ eng@@ ing exper@@ i@@ ence un@@ sc@@ a@@ th@@ ed or un@@ mar@@ ked by the exper@@ i@@ enc@@ e, as if my su@@ c@@ c@@ ess@@ es in life have come about from an ab@@ ili@@ ty to si@@ des@@ te@@ p or c@@ ir@@ c@@ um@@ n@@ av@@ ig@@ ate the pres@@ um@@ ed p@@ it@@ fall@@ s of a life with pro@@ s@@ the@@ tic@@ s, or what other people perc@@ ei@@ ve as my dis@@ ab@@ ili@@ t@@ y.
Bu@@ t, in fac@@ t, we are ch@@ an@@ ge@@ d. We are mark@@ ed, of cour@@ se, by a ch@@ all@@ eng@@ e, wh@@ e@@ ther ph@@ ysi@@ call@@ y, em@@ o@@ tion@@ ally or bo@@ th@@ .
And I'm going to su@@ g@@ ges@@ t that this is a good thing@@ .
A@@ d@@ vers@@ ity is@@ n't an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le that we need to get around in or@@ der to res@@ um@@ e li@@ ving our lif@@ e.
It's part of our lif@@ e.
And I ten@@ d to think of it like my s@@ ha@@ do@@ w.
S@@ om@@ e@@ tim@@ es I see a lot of it, some@@ tim@@ es there's very litt@@ l@@ e, but it's al@@ ways with m@@ e.
An@@ d, cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly, I'm not tr@@ ying to di@@ min@@ is@@ h the imp@@ ac@@ t, the wei@@ gh@@ t, of a per@@ son@@ 's stru@@ g@@ gl@@ e.
There is ad@@ vers@@ ity and ch@@ all@@ enge in lif@@ e, and it's all very real and rel@@ ative to every s@@ ing@@ le per@@ son@@ , but the ques@@ tion is@@ n't wh@@ e@@ ther or not you're going to me@@ et ad@@ vers@@ ity, but how you're going to me@@ et it.
So, our res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ty is not sim@@ pl@@ y shi@@ el@@ ding those we c@@ are for from ad@@ vers@@ ity, but pre@@ par@@ ing them to me@@ et it w@@ ell@@ .
And we do a dis@@ ser@@ vi@@ ce to our ki@@ ds when we make them fe@@ el that they're not e@@ qu@@ i@@ pp@@ ed to a@@ da@@ p@@ t.
Ther@@ e's an import@@ ant differ@@ ence and di@@ st@@ in@@ c@@ tion between the ob@@ jec@@ tive me@@ dic@@ al fac@@ t of my being an am@@ p@@ ut@@ e@@ e and the sub@@ jec@@ tive soci@@ et@@ al op@@ in@@ ion of wh@@ e@@ ther or not I'm dis@@ ab@@ le@@ d.
An@@ d, tru@@ th@@ ful@@ ly, the only real and con@@ si@@ st@@ ent dis@@ ab@@ ili@@ ty I've had to con@@ fr@@ on@@ t is the world ever thin@@ king that I could be des@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ed by those de@@ fin@@ iti@@ on@@ s.
In our des@@ ir@@ e to pro@@ t@@ ect those we c@@ are about by gi@@ ving them the col@@ d, har@@ d tr@@ ut@@ h about their me@@ dic@@ al pro@@ g@@ no@@ s@@ is, or@@ , in@@ de@@ ed, a pro@@ g@@ no@@ s@@ is on the exp@@ ec@@ ted qu@@ al@@ ity of their lif@@ e, we have to make s@@ ure that we don't put the first bri@@ ck in a w@@ all that will actually dis@@ able some@@ on@@ e.
Per@@ ha@@ ps the ex@@ ist@@ ing mo@@ de@@ l of only looking at what is b@@ ro@@ ken in you and how do we fi@@ x it, ser@@ ves to be more dis@@ abl@@ ing to the in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al than the pa@@ th@@ olog@@ y it@@ self@@ .
B@@ y not tre@@ ating the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess of a per@@ son@@ , by not ac@@ kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ ing their po@@ ten@@ c@@ y, we are cre@@ ating another ill on to@@ p of wh@@ at@@ ever nat@@ ur@@ al stru@@ g@@ g@@ le they might ha@@ ve.
We are eff@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ely gra@@ ding some@@ on@@ e's wor@@ th to our commun@@ ity.
So we need to see through the pa@@ th@@ olog@@ y and into the r@@ ang@@ e of human cap@@ ab@@ ili@@ t@@ y.
An@@ d, most import@@ ant@@ ly, there's a par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ shi@@ p between those perc@@ ei@@ ved de@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ en@@ ci@@ es and our gre@@ at@@ est cre@@ ative ab@@ ili@@ t@@ y.
So it's not about de@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ ing, or ne@@ g@@ at@@ ing, these more tr@@ ying tim@@ es as something we want to av@@ o@@ i@@ d or s@@ we@@ ep un@@ der the ru@@ g@@ , but in@@ ste@@ ad to find those o@@ pp@@ ort@@ un@@ iti@@ es w@@ ra@@ pp@@ ed in the ad@@ vers@@ ity.
So ma@@ y@@ be the idea I want to put out there is not so much o@@ ver@@ com@@ ing ad@@ vers@@ ity as it is op@@ en@@ ing our@@ sel@@ ves up to it, em@@ br@@ ac@@ ing it, gra@@ p@@ pl@@ ing with it, to use a w@@ res@@ tl@@ ing ter@@ m, ma@@ y@@ be even d@@ anc@@ ing with it.
An@@ d, per@@ ha@@ p@@ s, if we see ad@@ vers@@ ity as nat@@ ur@@ al, con@@ si@@ st@@ ent and us@@ ef@@ ul@@ , we're l@@ ess b@@ ur@@ den@@ ed by the pres@@ ence of it.
This ye@@ ar we c@@ el@@ eb@@ r@@ ate the 200@@ th b@@ ir@@ th@@ day of Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ win@@ , and it was 1@@ 50 years ag@@ o, when w@@ rit@@ ing about evol@@ u@@ tion, that D@@ ar@@ w@@ in ill@@ u@@ str@@ at@@ ed, I thin@@ k, a tr@@ ut@@ h about the human ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter.
T@@ o par@@ ap@@ hr@@ as@@ e: It's not the str@@ on@@ ges@@ t of the spec@@ ies that sur@@ vi@@ v@@ es, no@@ r is it the most in@@ tel@@ li@@ gen@@ t that sur@@ vi@@ v@@ es@@ ; it is the one that is most a@@ da@@ p@@ t@@ able to chang@@ e.
C@@ on@@ f@@ lic@@ t is the gen@@ es@@ is of cre@@ ation.
F@@ ro@@ m D@@ ar@@ win@@ 's wor@@ k, am@@ ong@@ st other@@ s, we can re@@ co@@ g@@ n@@ iz@@ e that the human ab@@ ili@@ ty to sur@@ vi@@ ve and fl@@ our@@ is@@ h is dri@@ ven by the stru@@ g@@ g@@ le of the human sp@@ ir@@ it through con@@ f@@ lic@@ t into trans@@ form@@ ation.
So, again@@ , trans@@ form@@ ation, a@@ da@@ p@@ t@@ ation, is our gre@@ at@@ est human sk@@ ill@@ .
An@@ d, per@@ ha@@ p@@ s, un@@ ti@@ l we're t@@ es@@ te@@ d, we don't know what we're made of@@ .
Ma@@ y@@ be that's what ad@@ vers@@ ity gi@@ ves us@@ : a sen@@ se of self@@ , a sen@@ se of our own po@@ wer@@ .
So, we can give our@@ sel@@ ves a gi@@ f@@ t.
We can re@@ -@@ imag@@ ine ad@@ vers@@ ity as something more than just t@@ ough tim@@ es.
Ma@@ y@@ be we can see it as chang@@ e.
A@@ d@@ vers@@ ity is just change that we ha@@ ven@@ 't a@@ da@@ p@@ ted our@@ sel@@ ves to y@@ et.
I think the gre@@ at@@ est ad@@ vers@@ ity that we've cre@@ ated for our@@ sel@@ ves is this idea of nor@@ m@@ al@@ c@@ y.
Now, wh@@ o@@ 's nor@@ m@@ al@@ ?
Ther@@ e's no nor@@ m@@ al.
Ther@@ e's com@@ mon@@ , there's ty@@ pic@@ al. Ther@@ e's no nor@@ m@@ al, and would you want to me@@ et that po@@ or@@ , b@@ ei@@ ge per@@ son if they ex@@ ist@@ ed@@ ?
I don't think so@@ .
If we can change this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m from one of ach@@ ie@@ ving nor@@ m@@ al@@ c@@ y to one of possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ty -- or po@@ ten@@ c@@ y, to be even a little bit more d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous -- we can rel@@ eas@@ e the po@@ wer of so many more childr@@ en, and inv@@ ite them to eng@@ age their r@@ are and v@@ al@@ u@@ able ab@@ ili@@ ti@@ es with the commun@@ ity.
An@@ th@@ ro@@ p@@ olog@@ ist@@ s tell us that the one thing we as hum@@ ans have al@@ ways re@@ qu@@ i@@ red of our commun@@ ity mem@@ ber@@ s is to be of us@@ e, to be able to con@@ tri@@ b@@ ut@@ e.
Ther@@ e's e@@ vi@@ den@@ ce that Ne@@ ander@@ th@@ al@@ s, 6@@ 0@@ ,000 years ag@@ o, car@@ ri@@ ed their el@@ der@@ ly and those with ser@@ i@@ ous ph@@ ysi@@ c@@ al in@@ j@@ ur@@ y, and per@@ ha@@ ps it's because the life exper@@ i@@ ence of sur@@ vi@@ v@@ al of these people pro@@ ved of v@@ al@@ u@@ e to the commun@@ ity.
They didn't vie@@ w these people as b@@ ro@@ ken and us@@ el@@ ess@@ ; they were se@@ en as r@@ are and v@@ al@@ u@@ abl@@ e.
A few years ag@@ o, I was in a foo@@ d mark@@ et in the to@@ wn where I gre@@ w up in that red z@@ one in nor@@ the@@ ast@@ ern P@@ enn@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ an@@ i@@ a, and I was stand@@ ing over a b@@ us@@ h@@ el of t@@ om@@ at@@ o@@ es.
It was sum@@ mer@@ tim@@ e: I had sh@@ or@@ ts on.
I he@@ ar this gu@@ y, his v@@ o@@ ice beh@@ ind me say, "@@ Well, if it is@@ n't A@@ im@@ e@@ e M@@ ul@@ lin@@ s@@ ."
And I tur@@ n ar@@ oun@@ d, and it's this ol@@ der man@@ . I have no idea who he is.
And I said, "@@ I'm sor@@ r@@ y, si@@ r@@ , have we m@@ et@@ ? I don't re@@ mem@@ ber me@@ et@@ ing you@@ ."
He said, "@@ Well, you w@@ oul@@ dn't re@@ mem@@ ber me@@ et@@ ing m@@ e.
I me@@ an, when we me@@ t I was del@@ i@@ ver@@ ing you from your mo@@ ther@@ 's wom@@ b@@ ."
O@@ h, that gu@@ y.
An@@ d, but of cour@@ se, actu@@ ally, it did c@@ li@@ ck@@ .
This man was D@@ r@@ . K@@ e@@ an, a man that I had only kno@@ wn about through my mo@@ ther@@ 's stor@@ ies of that da@@ y, bec@@ aus@@ e, of cour@@ se, ty@@ pic@@ al fas@@ hi@@ on, I ar@@ ri@@ ved l@@ ate for my b@@ ir@@ th@@ day by two we@@ ek@@ s.
And so my mo@@ ther@@ 's pr@@ en@@ at@@ al ph@@ ysi@@ ci@@ an had g@@ one on v@@ ac@@ ation, so the man who del@@ i@@ ver@@ ed me was a compl@@ ete str@@ ang@@ er to my par@@ ent@@ s.
An@@ d, because I was b@@ or@@ n with@@ out the fi@@ b@@ ul@@ a b@@ on@@ es, and had fe@@ et tur@@ n@@ ed in, and a few to@@ es in this foo@@ t and a few to@@ es in that, he had to be the be@@ ar@@ er -- this str@@ ang@@ er had to be the be@@ ar@@ er of b@@ ad ne@@ w@@ s.
He said to me, "@@ I had to give this pro@@ g@@ no@@ s@@ is to your par@@ ents that you would never wal@@ k, and you would never have the kind of mo@@ bi@@ li@@ ty that other ki@@ ds have or any kind of life of in@@ de@@ p@@ en@@ den@@ c@@ e, and you@@ 've been ma@@ king li@@ ar out of me ever sin@@ c@@ e@@ ."
The ex@@ tra@@ ord@@ in@@ ary thing is that he said he had sa@@ ved ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er c@@ li@@ pp@@ ing@@ s thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out my whole ch@@ ild@@ ho@@ o@@ d, wh@@ e@@ ther w@@ inn@@ ing a secon@@ d gra@@ de sp@@ ell@@ ing be@@ e, mar@@ ch@@ ing with the G@@ ir@@ l S@@ c@@ ou@@ t@@ s, you know, the H@@ all@@ o@@ we@@ en par@@ ad@@ e, w@@ inn@@ ing my col@@ le@@ ge sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ shi@@ p@@ , or any of my sp@@ or@@ ts vi@@ c@@ tor@@ i@@ es, and he was us@@ ing it, and in@@ te@@ gr@@ ating it into te@@ ach@@ ing res@@ id@@ ent stu@@ d@@ ent@@ s, m@@ ed stu@@ d@@ ents from H@@ ah@@ n@@ em@@ an@@ n Me@@ dic@@ al Sch@@ oo@@ l and Her@@ sh@@ ey Me@@ dic@@ al Sch@@ o@@ ol@@ .
And he called this part of the cour@@ se the X F@@ ac@@ tor@@ , the po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al of the human wi@@ ll@@ .
N@@ o pro@@ g@@ no@@ s@@ is can ac@@ coun@@ t for how po@@ wer@@ ful this could be as a d@@ et@@ er@@ min@@ ant in the qu@@ al@@ ity of some@@ on@@ e's lif@@ e.
And D@@ r@@ . K@@ e@@ an went on to tell me, he said, "@@ In my exper@@ i@@ enc@@ e, un@@ l@@ ess re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly t@@ old other@@ wis@@ e, and even if gi@@ ven a mo@@ dic@@ um of su@@ pp@@ or@@ t, if le@@ ft to their own de@@ vi@@ c@@ es, a ch@@ ild will ach@@ ie@@ v@@ e@@ ."
Se@@ e, D@@ r@@ . K@@ e@@ an made that shi@@ ft in thin@@ k@@ ing.
He under@@ st@@ oo@@ d that there's a differ@@ ence between the me@@ dic@@ al con@@ diti@@ on and what some@@ one might do with it.
And there's been a shi@@ ft in my thin@@ king over time, in that, if you had as@@ ked me at 1@@ 5 years ol@@ d, if I would have tra@@ ded pro@@ s@@ the@@ tic@@ s for fl@@ es@@ h@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ b@@ one leg@@ s, I w@@ oul@@ dn't have h@@ es@@ it@@ ated for a secon@@ d.
I as@@ pi@@ red to that kind of nor@@ m@@ al@@ c@@ y back th@@ en.
But if you as@@ k me to@@ da@@ y, I'm not so su@@ re.
And it's because of the exper@@ i@@ enc@@ es I've had with them@@ , not in sp@@ ite of the exper@@ i@@ enc@@ es I've had with them.
And per@@ ha@@ ps this shi@@ ft in me has happen@@ ed because I've been ex@@ pos@@ ed to more people who have op@@ en@@ ed do@@ or@@ s for me than those who have put li@@ ds and c@@ ast s@@ ha@@ do@@ ws on m@@ e.
Se@@ e, all you really need is one per@@ son to show you the ep@@ i@@ ph@@ any of your own po@@ wer@@ , and you're off@@ .
If you can h@@ and som@@ eb@@ o@@ dy the k@@ ey to their own po@@ wer -- the human sp@@ ir@@ it is so rec@@ ep@@ tive -- if you can do that and op@@ en a do@@ or for some@@ one at a c@@ ru@@ ci@@ al m@@ om@@ ent, you are e@@ duc@@ ating them in the bes@@ t sen@@ se.
Y@@ ou@@ 're te@@ ach@@ ing them to op@@ en do@@ or@@ s for them@@ sel@@ v@@ es.
In fac@@ t, the ex@@ ac@@ t me@@ an@@ ing of the wor@@ d "@@ e@@ duc@@ at@@ e@@ " comes from the ro@@ o@@ t wor@@ d "@@ e@@ duc@@ e@@ ."
It me@@ ans "@@ to br@@ ing for@@ th what is wi@@ thin@@ , to br@@ ing out po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al@@ ."
So again@@ , which po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al do we want to br@@ ing ou@@ t?
There was a c@@ ase stu@@ dy d@@ one in 19@@ 6@@ 0@@ s B@@ rit@@ ain@@ , when they were mo@@ ving from gr@@ am@@ ma@@ r sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s to comp@@ re@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ve sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s.
It's called the st@@ re@@ am@@ ing tri@@ al@@ s. We c@@ all it "@@ tr@@ ack@@ ing@@ " here in the St@@ at@@ es.
It's se@@ par@@ ating stu@@ d@@ ents from A@@ , B@@ , C@@ , D and so on.
And the "@@ A stu@@ d@@ ent@@ s@@ " get the t@@ ou@@ gh@@ er c@@ ur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um@@ , the bes@@ t te@@ ach@@ er@@ s, et@@ c@@ .
Well, they to@@ o@@ k, over a thre@@ e-@@ mon@@ th per@@ i@@ o@@ d, D@@ -@@ le@@ v@@ el stu@@ d@@ ent@@ s, ga@@ ve them A@@ '@@ s, t@@ old them they were "@@ A@@ '@@ s@@ ," t@@ old them they were b@@ righ@@ t, and at the end of this thre@@ e-@@ mon@@ th per@@ i@@ o@@ d, they were per@@ form@@ ing at A@@ -@@ le@@ vel@@ .
An@@ d, of cour@@ se, the hear@@ t@@ bre@@ ak@@ ing, f@@ li@@ p side of this stu@@ d@@ y, is that they to@@ ok the "@@ A stu@@ d@@ ent@@ s@@ " and t@@ old them they were "@@ D@@ '@@ s@@ ."
And that's what happen@@ ed at the end of that thre@@ e-@@ mon@@ th per@@ i@@ o@@ d.
Th@@ o@@ se who were still around in sch@@ o@@ ol@@ , bes@@ i@@ des the people who had dro@@ pp@@ ed ou@@ t.
A c@@ ru@@ ci@@ al part of this c@@ ase stu@@ dy was that the te@@ ach@@ ers were du@@ p@@ ed to@@ o.
The te@@ ach@@ ers didn't know a s@@ wit@@ ch had been ma@@ de.
They were sim@@ pl@@ y t@@ ol@@ d, "@@ Th@@ ese are the '@@ A@@ -@@ stu@@ d@@ ent@@ s@@ ,@@ ' these are the '@@ D@@ -@@ stu@@ d@@ ent@@ s@@ .@@ '@@ " And that's how they went about te@@ ach@@ ing them and tre@@ ating them.
So, I think that the only tru@@ e dis@@ ab@@ ili@@ ty is a c@@ r@@ us@@ h@@ ed sp@@ ir@@ it, a sp@@ ir@@ it that's been c@@ r@@ us@@ h@@ ed doesn't have ho@@ p@@ e, it doesn't see be@@ au@@ t@@ y, it no l@@ on@@ ger has our nat@@ ur@@ al, ch@@ ild@@ like c@@ u@@ ri@@ o@@ s@@ ity and our inn@@ ate ab@@ ili@@ ty to imag@@ in@@ e.
If in@@ ste@@ a@@ d, we can b@@ ol@@ ster a human sp@@ ir@@ it to ke@@ ep ho@@ p@@ e, to see be@@ au@@ ty in them@@ sel@@ ves and other@@ s, to be c@@ u@@ ri@@ ous and imag@@ in@@ ati@@ ve, then we are tr@@ ul@@ y us@@ ing our po@@ wer w@@ ell@@ .
When a sp@@ ir@@ it has those qu@@ al@@ iti@@ es, we are able to cre@@ ate new real@@ iti@@ es and new ways of bein@@ g@@ .
I'@@ d like to le@@ a@@ ve you with a po@@ em by a f@@ our@@ te@@ en@@ th@@ -@@ cent@@ ur@@ y Per@@ si@@ an po@@ et nam@@ ed H@@ af@@ i@@ z that my fri@@ en@@ d, J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es D@@ em@@ bo@@ is t@@ old me ab@@ ou@@ t, and the po@@ em is called "@@ The G@@ od Wh@@ o O@@ n@@ ly K@@ no@@ ws F@@ our W@@ ord@@ s@@ "@@ : "@@ E@@ very ch@@ ild has kno@@ wn Go@@ d, not the G@@ od of nam@@ es, not the G@@ od of don@@ '@@ t@@ s, but the G@@ od who only kno@@ ws f@@ our wor@@ ds and ke@@ ep@@ s re@@ pe@@ ating them@@ , sa@@ y@@ ing, '@@ C@@ ome d@@ ance with m@@ e.
